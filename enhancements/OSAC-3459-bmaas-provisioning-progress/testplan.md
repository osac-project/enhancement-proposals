# Testplan — OSAC-3459

## Overview

- **Feature:** OSAC-3459 — BMaaS Provisioning Progress and Step Visibility
- **Total test cases:** 15
- **Requirements covered:** 8 of 8
- **Interface changes covered:** 6 of 6

> The PRD does not use numbered `FR-N`/`NFR-N` IDs. The requirement IDs below are
> derived from the PRD's In Scope items, User Stories, and Out of Scope
> constraints, and match the requirement IDs used in `design.md`:
> FR-1 current-stage display; FR-2 provisioning stages mapped to backend signals;
> FR-3 auto-refresh; FR-4 terminal/failure state persisted for the life of the
> record; FR-5 per-stage failure messages; NFR-1 ~5s freshness; NFR-2 read-only;
> NFR-3 pattern-reuse consistency.
>
> This iteration surfaces **provisioning progress only** via staged
> `reason`/`message` on the existing `PROVISIONED` condition plus a terminal
> `READY` (no new proto/CRD fields). Deprovisioning progress and a durable ordered
> per-phase timeline with durations are deferred (see design "Deferred /
> Follow-up work"), so there are no timeline-array, deprovisioning, or
> finalizer-handshake test cases.

## Test Cases

### FR-1: The bare metal instance detail view shows the current provisioning stage and a human-readable message, computed from the instance conditions

#### TC-FR1-01: Progress view renders the four steps derived from the PROVISIONED reason

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-4 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- A bare metal instance is provisioning; its API status has `PROVISIONED`
  `status = False` with `reason = Provisioning` and a curated `message`, and
  `READY` not yet `True`.

##### Steps

1. Open the instance detail page.
2. Inspect the rendered progress view.

##### Expected Results

- Four ordered steps appear: Host Allocation, Provisioning, Network Setup, Ready.
- Host Allocation is shown as complete; Provisioning is shown as the current
  in-progress step; Network Setup and Ready are shown as not started.
- The current (Provisioning) step shows the curated `message` from the
  `PROVISIONED` condition; no per-step duration is shown.

#### TC-FR1-02: API returns PROVISIONED with the stage reason and curated message; READY terminal

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- A bare metal instance has completed Host Allocation and is in the Provisioning
  stage.

##### Steps

1. Issue `GET /api/fulfillment/v1/baremetal_instances/{id}`.
2. Read `status.conditions`.

##### Expected Results

- The `PROVISIONED` condition has `status = False`, `reason = Provisioning`, and a
  non-empty curated `message` (not raw error text).
- The `READY` condition is not `True`.
- No new phase/timeline fields are present on the status (the change is carried
  entirely on existing condition `reason`/`message`).

### FR-2: The provisioning workflow presents four stages, each derived from an authoritative operator condition, order-independently

#### TC-FR2-01: Operator lifecycle conditions map to the correct furthest-advanced stage

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-2 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Fulfillment reconciler unit test harness with `BareMetalInstance` CR fixtures
  carrying operator lifecycle conditions in varying orders.

##### Steps

1. Build a fixture with `Allocated = True` and `ProvisionTemplateComplete` not
   set, with the conditions listed in a non-sequential order.
2. Run `syncStatus()`.
3. Advance the fixture to `ProvisionTemplateComplete = True`, network conditions
   not yet True, and re-run.

##### Expected Results

- After step 2, `PROVISIONED.reason = Provisioning` — the furthest-advanced True
  condition selects the stage regardless of condition ordering in the CR.
- After step 3, `PROVISIONED.reason = NetworkSetup`.
- In both cases `PROVISIONED.message` is the curated string for that stage and
  `PROVISIONED.status = False`.

#### TC-FR2-02: PROVISIONED flips True at provisioning completion and READY True at readiness

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-2 | critical | automated |

##### Preconditions

- A CR fixture with all provisioning/network conditions True but the instance not
  yet powered-on ready, and a second fixture that is additionally available/ready.

##### Steps

1. Run `syncStatus()` on the all-provisioned-but-not-ready fixture.
2. Run `syncStatus()` on the ready fixture.

##### Expected Results

- After step 1, `PROVISIONED.status = True` with `reason = Provisioned` and its
  terminal `message`; `READY` is not `True`.
- After step 2, `READY.status = True` with `reason = Ready` and its terminal
  `message`.

#### TC-FR2-03: A stage with no work does not leave the instance stuck

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-2 | medium | automated |

##### Preconditions

- A CR fixture for an instance that requests no network attachment, driven to
  provisioning completion (network conditions satisfied trivially).

##### Steps

1. Run `syncStatus()` through to completion.
2. Inspect the derived stage progression.
3. Render the progress view for the completed instance.

##### Expected Results

- The derivation advances past Network Setup (it is treated as satisfied) rather
  than lingering on `reason = NetworkSetup`; `PROVISIONED` reaches `True`.
- The UI shows the Network Setup step as complete, not stuck as not-started or
  in-progress.

#### TC-FR2-04: The CR→stage derivation is exhaustive over the operator condition constants, so a CR-condition change breaks a test rather than the proto

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-6 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- The bare-metal-fulfillment-operator `api/v1alpha1` package, which exports the
  `HostCondition*` constants and the pure `DeriveProvisioningProgress` derivation
  used by the fulfillment reconciler. This is an operator-package unit test (it
  guards the contract at the source, next to the constants), not a
  fulfillment-service test.

##### Steps

1. Enumerate the exported `HostCondition*` condition-type constants in the package
   (via the package's declared list of known conditions that the test asserts
   against the exported constants — see expected results).
2. For each constant, assert `DeriveProvisioningProgress` classifies it — it either
   selects a provisioning stage, marks provisioning complete / ready, maps to a
   failure classification, or appears in the derivation's explicit
   "intentionally not surfaced" list.
3. Feed the derivation a synthetic, unknown condition type and a fixture missing a
   previously-mapped condition, and observe the classification result.

##### Expected Results

- Every exported `HostCondition*` constant is classified (mapped or explicitly
  not-surfaced); no constant is left unhandled. The set of constants the test
  iterates is derived from the exported constants themselves, so **adding** a new
  `HostCondition*` without classifying it fails this test.
- **Renaming or removing** a `HostCondition*` that the derivation references fails
  to compile or fails this test (the constant the derivation names no longer
  exists / no longer matches), surfacing the CR→proto coupling as a build/test
  failure in the operator repo — not as a silently wrong or empty proto `reason`
  observed later by the fulfillment reconciler.
- The synthetic unknown condition is ignored (does not select a stage) and its
  presence is flagged as unclassified by the exhaustiveness assertion, confirming
  the guard fires for an unrecognised condition.

### FR-3: The progress view auto-refreshes approximately every 5 seconds without user action

#### TC-FR3-01: Detail view advances the stage on refetch without user interaction

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-4 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- An active instance rendered on the detail page; the mock API advances
  `PROVISIONED.reason` from `Provisioning` to `NetworkSetup` between fetches.

##### Steps

1. Render the detail page and let the query refetch (no user action).
2. Observe the progress view after the refetch resolves.

##### Expected Results

- Without any click or reload, the Provisioning step transitions to complete and
  Network Setup becomes the current in-progress step.
- The change of current step is announced to assistive technology (the new
  current step is conveyed without relying on color alone).

### FR-4: The terminal or failure state (which stage the instance reached or failed at, and its message) persists for the life of the fulfillment instance record

> Re-scoped for this iteration: the single coarse condition persists the
> terminal/failure `reason`/`message`, not a full ordered per-phase history with
> durations. The durable timeline is a deferred follow-up.

#### TC-FR4-01: Completed instance persists terminal conditions and renders all steps succeeded

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- An instance that reached readiness: API `PROVISIONED = True` (`reason
  Provisioned`) and `READY = True` (`reason Ready`).

##### Steps

1. With the instance at readiness, make the source `BareMetalInstance` CR
   unavailable (delete/detach it on the hub) while the fulfillment record remains
   live, so any subsequent response must be served from the DB rather than the CR.
2. Open the completed instance's detail page and inspect the progress view.
3. Issue `GET /api/fulfillment/v1/baremetal_instances/{id}` and read
   `status.conditions`.

##### Expected Results

- All four steps are shown as complete; no step is shown as in-progress or
  current; no per-step duration is asserted (none is shown this iteration).
- The API returns `PROVISIONED = True` and `READY = True` with their terminal
  reasons/messages, served from the DB independent of the now-unavailable CR — a
  CR-backed response could not have produced this result.

#### TC-FR4-02: Failed instance persists the failing condition, then archives to 404

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-1 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- An instance whose Provisioning stage failed: `PROVISIONED = False`,
  `reason = ProvisionJobFailed`, with the IC-5 curated `message`.

##### Steps

1. With the instance's Provisioning stage failed, make the source
   `BareMetalInstance` CR unavailable (delete/detach it on the hub) while the
   fulfillment record remains live, before the first `GET`.
2. Issue `GET /api/fulfillment/v1/baremetal_instances/{id}` and read
   `status.conditions`.
3. Only after that assertion, let fulfillment soft-delete and archive the record
   to `archived_<table>` (on finalizer removal), then issue the same `GET` again.

##### Expected Results

- Step 2 (source CR already unavailable): the response retains the failing
  `PROVISIONED` condition (`False`, `reason = ProvisionJobFailed`, curated
  `message`) served from the DB independent of the CR, so the failure remains
  viewable after the CR is gone — a CR-backed response could not have produced this
  result.
- Step 3: returns 404 — the released record has been archived and there is no
  archive-read path, so FR-4 is bounded to the life of the live record (matching
  VMaaS/CaaS).

### FR-5: Failure descriptions identify the stage and condition in human-readable terms; no raw internal errors are surfaced

#### TC-FR5-01: Failed stage shows its defined human-readable message

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-5 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Reconciler test harness with a table of fixtures, one per IC-5 failure reason
  (`NoMatchingHosts`, `HostAllocationFailed`, `ProvisionJobFailed`,
  `NetworkAttachmentFailed`, `NetworkHandoffFailed`, `IPDiscoveryFailed`,
  `ReadyTimeout`), each injecting that stage's failure into the failing condition.

##### Steps

1. For each IC-5 reason, run `syncStatus()` on its fixture.
2. Read the failing condition's `reason`/`message` from the API, and record
   **which** condition carries the failure (`PROVISIONED` vs `READY`).
3. Render the progress view for that failed instance and read the failed step's
   name and message.

##### Expected Results

- For every IC-5 reason, the failing condition's `message` equals that reason's
  exact IC-5 string byte-for-byte (e.g. `ProvisionJobFailed` → "OS installation
  and configuration did not complete; the provisioning job failed."). The **full
  IC-5 failure vocabulary is exercised** — one message per reason — and no other
  value is emitted; the mapping is fixed and deterministic.
- For every IC-5 reason, the failure is carried by the condition IC-5 names: the
  six provisioning-stage reasons (`NoMatchingHosts`, `HostAllocationFailed`,
  `ProvisionJobFailed`, `NetworkAttachmentFailed`, `NetworkHandoffFailed`,
  `IPDiscoveryFailed`) on `PROVISIONED`, and `ReadyTimeout` on `READY`. The test
  asserts the expected carrier per reason.
- For each reason, the progress view marks the IC-5 **Failed step** for that
  reason (`ReadyTimeout` → Ready; the provisioning reasons → Host Allocation,
  Provisioning, or Network Setup per the IC-5 table) as failed, and the same
  message renders verbatim for that failed step.

#### TC-FR5-02: Raw internal error text is not surfaced in the conditions

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-5 | medium | automated |

##### Preconditions

- A stage failure whose underlying backend error contains an internal stack trace
  or raw AAP/backend error string.

##### Steps

1. Inject the backend failure with a raw internal error.
2. Read the failing condition's `reason`/`message` and inspect **every** condition
   in the API `status.conditions` payload.

##### Expected Results

- `message` contains only the stage-specific human-readable text from the fixed
  vocabulary.
- The raw backend error string does not appear in `reason`, `message`, or anywhere
  in the API `status.conditions` payload.

### NFR-1: Progress reflects backend state within approximately 5 seconds

#### TC-NFR1-01: A hub CR condition change reaches the API within the freshness window via the feedback→Signal path

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-3 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- Fulfillment reconciler and the osac-operator feedback controller running against
  a kind cluster, at steady state (no in-flight proto diff), for an instance whose
  CR is at the Provisioning stage.

##### Steps

1. Record `t0`, then update the `BareMetalInstance` CR on the hub so the operator
   conditions advance the derived stage from Provisioning to Network Setup.
2. Poll `GET /api/fulfillment/v1/baremetal_instances/{id}` at a sub-second cadence
   and record `t1` — the first response with `PROVISIONED.reason = NetworkSetup`.

##### Expected Results

- The feedback controller fires `Signal(id)` on the condition change, the
  reconciler re-reads the CR and updates the DB, and the API reflects the new
  stage. The assertion is **bounded**: `t1 - t0` ≤ the NFR-1 freshness deadline
  (single-digit seconds; ~5s soft target), and the update arrives **before** the
  periodic full-resync interval would fire (freshness comes from the `Signal`
  path, not the resync fallback) and without any new watch/informer. To isolate
  the `Signal` path, the periodic full-resync interval is configured well above
  the asserted bound.

#### TC-NFR1-02: The detail view reflects an API stage change within the bounded UI poll interval and stops at terminal

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-4 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- The instance detail page is rendered for a **non-terminal** instance; the mock
  API returns `PROVISIONED.reason = Provisioning`. Fake timers control the query
  `refetchInterval`.

##### Steps

1. Render the detail page and let the initial fetch settle on the Provisioning
   stage.
2. Update the mock API to return `PROVISIONED.reason = NetworkSetup`, then advance
   fake timers by the dedicated ~5s `refetchInterval` (no user interaction).
3. Inspect the progress view.
4. Drive the instance to a resting **successful** terminal state (`PROVISIONED =
   True`, `READY = True`), let one more interval elapse, then update the mock API
   again and advance timers.
5. Repeat with a **failed** terminal fixture: drive the instance to a provisioning
   condition `False` with a failure `reason`, let one more interval elapse, update
   the mock API again, and advance timers.

##### Expected Results

- After step 2's single ~5s interval, the progress view reflects Network Setup
  in progress without any click or reload — the DB→UI leg is bounded to the dedicated per-page
  ~5s poll, not the global ~10s default. This complements TC-NFR1-01, which
  measures the CR→API (DB) leg; together they bound end-to-end freshness.
- After step 4, once the instance is at the successful terminal state (`READY =
  True`) the query **stops refetching**: the later mock-API change is not picked
  up.
- After step 5, a **failed** terminal instance (a provisioning condition `False`
  with a failure reason) likewise **stops refetching**: polling halts at both the
  successful and failed terminal states, matching the design's terminal-stop rule.

### NFR-2: The progress and failure display is read-only

#### TC-NFR2-01: The progress view exposes no retry or re-provision control

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-4 | high | automated |

##### Preconditions

- A failed instance rendered on the detail page.

##### Steps

1. Open the failed instance's detail page.
2. Query the progress view region for interactive controls.

##### Expected Results

- No retry, re-provision, or other mutating button/link is present in the progress
  region.
- The steps expose no click/select behavior (display-only progress view).

### NFR-3: Progress reuses the OSAC coarse-condition staged reason/message pattern for cross-service consistency

> "Reuse" here means the same shape CaaS adopted in OSAC-4441 (PR #646): a single
> coarse progress condition whose `reason`/`message` carry the furthest-advanced
> stage, refreshed each reconcile, with a terminal `READY`. No new
> phase/timeline construct is introduced.

#### TC-NFR3-01: Coarse state and conditions are retained; PROVISIONED reason equals the current stage

| Interface Change | Priority | Automation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| IC-2 | medium | automated |

##### Preconditions

- An active instance in the Network Setup stage.

##### Steps

1. Read `status.state` and `status.conditions` from the API.

##### Expected Results

- `status.state` still returns the coarse lifecycle value and `status.conditions`
  still includes the existing condition set (the shared conditions table is
  unaffected).
- The `PROVISIONED` condition `reason` equals `NetworkSetup`, matching the current
  provisioning stage — the same coarse-condition staged-reason shape CaaS uses.

## Gaps

### Requirement Coverage Gaps

All PRD requirements in scope for this iteration have test cases. Deprovisioning
progress and the durable ordered per-phase timeline are deferred (out of scope
here) and are intentionally not covered.

### Interface Change Coverage Gaps

All interface changes are exercised by test cases (IC-1: TC-FR1-02, TC-FR4-01,
TC-FR4-02; IC-2: TC-FR2-01, TC-FR2-02, TC-FR2-03, TC-NFR3-01; IC-3: TC-NFR1-01;
IC-4: TC-FR1-01, TC-FR3-01, TC-NFR1-02, TC-NFR2-01; IC-5: TC-FR5-01, TC-FR5-02;
IC-6: TC-FR2-04).
