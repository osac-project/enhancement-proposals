# BMaaS Provisioning Progress and Step Visibility

## Summary

This design surfaces bare metal provisioning progress by populating the existing
`BareMetalInstance` conditions — it adds **no new status fields**. The
bare-metal-fulfillment-operator owns the mapping from its own lifecycle
conditions to the furthest-advanced provisioning stage, exposed as a pure,
dependency-light function (`DeriveProvisioningProgress`) in its `api/v1alpha1`
package. The fulfillment reconciler — which already imports that package — calls
it and applies the presentation layer: it stamps the derived stage onto the
single `PROVISIONED` condition as a fixed-vocabulary `reason` plus a curated,
non-internal-leaking `message`; `READY` remains the terminal condition. Keeping
the condition→stage semantics next to the conditions themselves means the
operator's conditions and the code that interprets them live and are tested
together, so a CR-condition change that would otherwise silently break the proto
stage is caught at the source (see IC-6). This is the same coarse-condition,
staged-`reason`/`message` shape CaaS just adopted for its `PROGRESSING` condition
(OSAC-4441 / PR #646), so BMaaS becomes consistent with the rest of OSAC rather
than introducing a BMaaS-specific construct. The UI renders a read-only progress
view of the stage on the instance detail page (its visual design is deferred to a
UI-focused design). The DB copy stays fresh within
seconds via the existing osac-operator feedback→`Signal` path (no new watch, no
new proto or CRD field).

Scope note (this iteration): **provisioning progress only**. Deprovisioning
progress, a durable ordered per-phase timeline with per-phase durations, and
`CONFIGURATION_APPLIED`-driven day-2 progress are explicitly deferred (see
Non-Goals and Deferred / Follow-up work). See [PRD](prd.md) for requirements.

## Motivation

Today a bare metal instance shows only a coarse lifecycle badge (`PROVISIONING`,
`READY`, `FAILED`) plus a raw conditions table in the UI. The fulfillment
reconciler that derives the instance's API status reads only two of the operator
conditions and sets the `PROVISIONED` condition as a binary ratchet with an
**empty reason and message** [Codebase:
fulfillment-service/internal/controllers/baremetalinstance/baremetalinstance_reconciler_function.go]
— so the largely sequential provisioning signal the operator already tracks (host
allocation, the provisioning job, network handoff, and readiness) is discarded
before it reaches the API. When a deployment stalls or fails, the user cannot tell
which step is running or where it stopped.

Two implementation-level facts shape this design. First, bare-metal provisioning
is driven by a single opaque AAP job (`osac-create-bare-metal-instance`), not by
separable metal3/Ironic states — the metal3 `BareMetalHost` is inventory and
power management only and exposes no observable per-step provisioning signal
[Research: loop-back Domain 7]. Hardware preparation, OS deployment, and
configuration therefore all happen inside that one job and cannot be
independently observed; they collapse into a single **Provisioning** stage. Only
Host Allocation, Network Setup, and Ready are independently observable via
osac-operator conditions. Second, the DB↔hub freshness path already exists: the
osac-operator feedback controller already watches the hub CRs and rings
fulfillment via a `Signal(id)` RPC on status change, and the fulfillment
reconciler already re-reads the CR and updates the DB within seconds — so no new
watch is needed, only richer `reason`/`message` content on the conditions the
reconciler already writes [Research: loop-back Domain 8].

Crucially, OSAC already has an established, just-merged shape for exactly this
problem. CaaS expresses installation progress as a fixed, order-independent stage
vocabulary folded into the `reason`/`message` of its single `PROGRESSING`
condition, refreshed on every reconcile, with a terminal `READY` condition
(`applyProgressingStageDetail` over `clusterOrderProvisioningStages`) [Codebase:
osac-operator/internal/controller/feedback_controller.go; PR #646 / OSAC-4441].
BMaaS should reuse that shape rather than invent a parallel one.

This design closes the visibility gap for provisioning while keeping the
cross-service progress experience consistent with CaaS (OSAC-1604) and VMaaS
(OSAC-1027).

### Goals

- Reuse the OSAC coarse-condition progress pattern: express the current
  provisioning stage as the `reason` of the existing `PROVISIONED` condition and a
  curated human-readable `message`, refreshed each reconcile, with `READY` as the
  terminal condition — the same shape CaaS uses, so the shared status label and
  conditions table stay consistent across services [PRD: In Scope; Locked pattern
  reuse].
- Add **no new proto or CRD status fields**: populate the `reason`/`message`
  fields that already exist on `BareMetalInstanceCondition`, and fix the current
  empty-reason `PROVISIONED` ratchet mis-wiring so the stage progression
  (Host Allocation → Provisioning → Network Setup → provisioned → Ready) is
  actually surfaced.
- Reuse the existing osac-operator feedback→`Signal` freshness path so the stage
  reflected in the API tracks backend changes within seconds — no new hub-side
  watch is introduced.
- Introduce a read-only progress view on the instance detail page, computed from
  the current stage and reusable later by VMaaS/CaaS without a model change; its
  visual/interaction design is left to a UI-focused design.

### Non-Goals

- No user-initiated actions on the progress view: no retry, re-provision, or any
  mutating control [PRD: Out of Scope].
- No changes to the metal3/Ironic provisioning automation or AAP playbook logic;
  this design only observes and surfaces existing backend signals [PRD: Out of
  Scope].
- No per-phase log or command output [PRD: Out of Scope].
- No cross-tenant aggregated list of in-progress instances [PRD: Out of Scope].
- No progress-model changes for VMaaS or CaaS in this feature.
- **No new phase/timeline status fields.** The single coarse condition retains
  only the *current* stage and its `lastTransitionTime`, not an ordered per-phase
  history with per-phase durations. A durable, viewable-after-completion timeline
  is deferred (see Deferred / Follow-up work).
- **No deprovisioning progress** in this iteration (deferred — see below).
- **No `CONFIGURATION_APPLIED`-driven provisioning progress.**
  `CONFIGURATION_APPLIED` is reserved for future day-2 configuration operations
  and is not part of this design's progress surface.

### Deferred / Follow-up work

These were part of the original design intent and PRD but are intentionally
deferred so this iteration ships the consistent, low-risk core:

- **Durable ordered per-phase timeline (DoD #3).** A persisted, ordered history
  of every phase with per-phase transition timestamps and derived durations — and
  any provisioning event-timeline/log view — is a separate, cross-cutting
  follow-up. Model B's single coarse condition intentionally keeps only the
  current stage; the terminal/failure state persists (see Persistence), but the
  full ordered history does not. Tracked as a follow-up; the per-stage
  `lastTransitionTime` already present on the condition makes such a timeline
  derivable later without changing this design.
- **Deprovisioning progress.** Teardown stage visibility (Teardown Initiated →
  Cleaning → Released), including any release/finalizer coordination, is deferred.
  Deletion continues to surface only the coarse `DELETING` state as it does today.
- **Day-2 configuration progress via `CONFIGURATION_APPLIED`.** Surfacing progress
  of post-provision configuration changes is future work reserved to that
  condition.

## Proposal

The change spans three components in dependency order; there is **no proto or CRD
schema change**.

1. **bare-metal-fulfillment-operator (`api/v1alpha1`).** Add a pure,
   dependency-light function, `DeriveProvisioningProgress(conds
   []metav1.Condition) ProvisioningProgress`, co-located with the `HostCondition*`
   constants it reads. It maps the operator's existing lifecycle conditions to the
   furthest-advanced provisioning stage (order-independently) and reports whether
   provisioning is complete, the instance is ready, or a stage failed (with a fixed
   failure classification). This is additive — a new function and a small typed
   stage/result, no CRD field and no change to any generated type — so
   `make manifests generate` is not required; the package stays apimachinery-only
   (no controller-runtime import) so the fulfillment reconciler can depend on it.
   The operator owns the *technical* condition→stage contract; the exhaustiveness
   of that contract is guarded by a co-located test (see IC-6).

2. **fulfillment-service reconciler.** Extend `syncStatus()` to call
   `DeriveProvisioningProgress` and apply the *presentation* layer: set the
   `PROVISIONED` condition's `reason` to the derived fixed stage value and its
   `message` to a curated, non-internal-leaking string; flip `PROVISIONED` to
   `True` when the result reports provisioning complete; set `READY` to the
   terminal reason/message when it reports ready; and on a reported stage failure
   set the relevant condition `False` with the fixed failure `reason` and its
   curated `message`. This replaces today's empty-reason ratchet. The reconciler
   already imports the operator's `api/v1alpha1` module (`require` + local
   `replace` in `go.mod`), and the operator does not depend on fulfillment-service,
   so there is no import cycle.

3. **osac-ui.** Add a read-only progress view to the instance detail view that
   derives the four user-facing steps (Host Allocation → Provisioning → Network
   Setup → Ready) from the current `PROVISIONED` `reason` and the `READY`
   condition: it shows which step is complete, which is in progress, and — on
   failure — which step failed together with the curated `message`. It
   auto-refreshes while the instance is non-terminal and stops once terminal. The
   concrete visual and interaction design (layout, component choice, per-step
   presentation) is deferred to a UI-focused design (see Open Questions).

The existing coarse `state` and `conditions` remain the single source of status;
this design only enriches the `reason`/`message` the reconciler already had the
mechanism to write (`updateCondition(type, status, reason, message)` +
`sanitizeConditionMessage`). Because the fulfillment DB already stores the
instance's proto status as JSON, the terminal/failure `reason`/`message` persist
across CR deletion with no new storage.

**Stage vocabulary (the `PROVISIONED` `reason` while provisioning).** A fixed,
ordered, order-independent vocabulary — mirroring CaaS's
`clusterOrderProvisioningStages` (furthest-advanced stage wins, so the result
never depends on condition ordering):

| Stage `reason` | Meaning | Backend signal (furthest-advanced True) |
|---|---|---|
| `HostAllocation` | Selecting and allocating a bare metal host | before `Allocated` True |
| `Provisioning` | Installing the OS and applying configuration (single opaque AAP job) | `Allocated` True, before `ProvisionTemplateComplete` True |
| `NetworkSetup` | Attaching networks and discovering addresses | `ProvisionTemplateComplete` True, before network conditions True |

Once the network/provisioning conditions are all True, `PROVISIONED` flips
`True` with reason `Provisioned` (message: "Infrastructure has been allocated and
provisioned."). When the instance reaches its powered-on ready state, `READY`
flips `True` with reason `Ready` (message: "The instance is ready."). The
**current stage** is therefore always derivable as `PROVISIONED.reason` (while
`PROVISIONED` is not yet `True`), exactly as CaaS derives it from
`PROGRESSING.reason`.

**Why reuse `PROVISIONED` rather than add a `PROGRESSING` condition.** BMaaS has
no `PROGRESSING` condition, but it does not need one: `PROVISIONED` is the natural
progress-bearing condition for the provisioning sequence (its proto meaning,
"infrastructure has been allocated/provisioned", is precisely what the sequence
converges to). Using its `reason` to carry the in-flight stage and flipping it
`True` at completion keeps the API surface unchanged and matches the CaaS
one-progress-condition shape. `CONFIGURATION_APPLIED` is deliberately left out of
the progress narrative and reserved for day-2 operations.

### Workflow Description

Actors: **Tenant User**, **Tenant Admin**, and **Cloud Provider Admin** — all
have the same read-only view of an instance they can already see.

Starting state: a bare metal instance has been ordered and its `BareMetalInstance`
CR exists on the hub.

1. The user opens the instance detail page. The page issues a
   `GET /api/fulfillment/v1/baremetal_instances/{id}` and derives the four known
   steps — Host Allocation → Provisioning → Network Setup → Ready — from
   `status.conditions`: the `PROVISIONED` `reason` names the current stage (earlier
   steps are complete, later steps are not yet started), and `READY` `True` marks
   the terminal step done.
2. The view shows, per step, whether it is complete, in progress, not yet started,
   or failed, and shows the curated `message` from the driving condition for the
   current step. Per-step *durations* are **not** shown in this iteration (the
   single condition retains only the current stage's `lastTransitionTime`) — a
   durable per-phase timeline is deferred.
3. While the instance is non-terminal, the detail view auto-refreshes on a fixed
   ~5-second interval (a per-page override of the global ~10s default); the
   operator updates the CR conditions, the osac-operator feedback controller
   signals fulfillment, which re-syncs the DB within seconds, and the next refresh
   shows the advanced stage without any user action.
4. On failure, the view marks the failing step as failed and shows a
   phase-specific, human-readable `message` (for example, "OS installation and
   configuration did not complete; the provisioning job failed."); no raw internal
   error is shown, and no retry control is offered.
5. When provisioning completes, `PROVISIONED` flips `True` while `READY` is not yet
   `True`: the first three steps are complete and the **Ready** step becomes the
   current step; the view keeps refreshing.
6. When the instance reaches its powered-on ready state, `READY` flips `True`; all
   four steps are complete and auto-refresh stops.
7. After the instance is released and its CR removed, the detail view continues to
   serve the last persisted conditions (terminal or failure `reason`/`message`)
   from the fulfillment DB until the instance record is archived on finalizer
   removal, after which the public `GET` returns 404 as for any released instance.

        API-->>UI: conditions
        UI->>User: render progress view (derived from stage)
    end
```

This diagram shows the freshness path the design reuses — the existing
osac-operator feedback controller → `Signal(id)` → reconciler re-read → DB write —
and the UI polling path. Total UI-visible freshness has two bounded parts:
source-side (CR→DB) is bounded by the existing feedback path (seconds), and DB→UI
is bounded by the UI's ~5s per-page poll while the instance is non-terminal.
Polling stops once the instance is terminal.

### API Extensions

This enhancement changes **no** API schema: it adds no gRPC services, webhooks,
aggregated API servers, proto messages, enums, or fields, and no CRD fields. It
populates the existing `reason` and `message` fields of the existing
`BareMetalInstanceCondition` and does not read or modify resources owned by other
teams (in particular, it does not depend on metal3 CRD internals). It does add one
exported Go function (`DeriveProvisioningProgress`) and a small result type to the
bare-metal-fulfillment-operator's `api/v1alpha1` package — a code-level contract between two
OSAC components, not an external API schema change (see IC-2 and IC-6).

The concrete interface changes (referenced by the testplan as IC-N):

- **IC-1 — Staged `reason`/`message` on the existing `PROVISIONED` condition (no
  schema change).** The fulfillment reconciler populates the existing `reason`
  (fixed stage vocabulary) and `message` (curated prose) of the `PROVISIONED`
  `BareMetalInstanceCondition`, and the terminal `reason`/`message` on `READY`.
  No proto/CRD change. Requirements: FR-1, FR-2, NFR-3.
- **IC-2 — Stage derivation (operator-owned) + fulfillment presentation
  (`syncStatus`).** The condition→stage mapping is owned by the
  bare-metal-fulfillment-operator as a pure function, `DeriveProvisioningProgress`,
  over its existing lifecycle conditions (`Allocated`,
  `ProvisionTemplateComplete`, network/power conditions) using a fixed,
  order-independent stage list as CaaS does (the derivation contract itself is
  IC-6). The fulfillment reconciler's `syncStatus()` calls it and applies
  presentation: stamp `PROVISIONED.reason`/`message`; flip `PROVISIONED` `True` at
  provisioning completion and `READY` `True` at readiness; extend
  `sanitizeConditionMessage` to cover the in-progress stage vocabulary (today it
  returns text only for `status == True`). Fixes the current empty-reason ratchet.
  Requirements: FR-1, FR-2, FR-5.
- **IC-3 — Freshness via the existing feedback→`Signal` path.** The osac-operator
  feedback `Signal(id)` already fires on `BareMetalInstance` status (condition)
  changes; confirm it fires on `PROVISIONED`/`READY` `reason`/`message`
  transitions so the reconciler re-syncs the DB within seconds. No new watch or
  informer. Requirements: NFR-1.
- **IC-4 — UI progress view.** Add a read-only progress view to the instance
  detail view, deriving the four steps from the `PROVISIONED` `reason` and `READY`
  condition, showing the curated `message`, and auto-refreshing while non-terminal.
  The concrete visual/interaction design (layout, component, accessibility
  affordances) is owned by a UI-focused design (see Open Questions). Requirements:
  FR-1, FR-3, FR-5, NFR-2.
- **IC-5 — Failure message mapping.** Define the exact human-readable failure
  `message` the reconciler writes into the failing condition. The mapping is
  **fixed and deterministic**: each failure reason maps to exactly one message
  string, so a consumer or test can assert one expected `message` per reason. The
  **Condition carrier** column names which condition holds the failure —
  `PROVISIONED` for the provisioning stages, `READY` for the Ready stage — and the
  **Failed step** column names the UI step IC-4 marks as failed.
  (Deprovisioning failures are out of scope this iteration.)

  | Stage | Failure reason (from failing condition/job) | Condition carrier | Failed step | Exact `message` |
  |-------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
  | Host Allocation | `NoMatchingHosts` (no available host matched the profile) | `PROVISIONED` | Host Allocation | "No bare metal host matched the requested profile." |
  | Host Allocation | `HostAllocationFailed` (host search/claim error other than no-match) | `PROVISIONED` | Host Allocation | "Host allocation failed." |
  | Provisioning | `ProvisionJobFailed` (the `osac-create-bare-metal-instance` job failed) | `PROVISIONED` | Provisioning | "OS installation and configuration did not complete; the provisioning job failed." |
  | Network Setup | `NetworkAttachmentFailed` | `PROVISIONED` | Network Setup | "Network attachment did not complete." |
  | Network Setup | `NetworkHandoffFailed` | `PROVISIONED` | Network Setup | "Network handoff (reboot) did not complete." |
  | Network Setup | `IPDiscoveryFailed` | `PROVISIONED` | Network Setup | "IP address discovery did not complete." |
  | Ready | `ReadyTimeout` (host did not reach powered-on ready state) | `READY` | Ready | "The instance did not reach its powered-on ready state." |

  These strings are the complete vocabulary; the reconciler never copies a raw
  operator/AAP/metal3 error string into `message`, and no other message value is
  emitted. Requirements: FR-5.
- **IC-6 — CR→stage derivation contract (`DeriveProvisioningProgress`).** The
  shared function is the contract between the operator's CR conditions and the
  proto stage the fulfillment reconciler surfaces. It is **exhaustive over the
  operator's `HostCondition*` constants**: every condition is either mapped to a
  stage / terminal / failure classification or explicitly listed as intentionally
  not surfaced. A co-located unit test enumerates the exported condition constants
  and fails if any one is unclassified — so adding, renaming, or removing a CR
  condition without updating the derivation surfaces as a failing test in the
  operator repo rather than a silently wrong (or empty) proto `reason`. Because the
  test lives in the operator package next to the constants, it breaks in the same
  change that edits the conditions. Requirements: FR-2, NFR-3.

Operational impact: if the operator is down, the stage stops advancing but the
last-synced conditions remain served from the DB. If the fulfillment reconciler
is down, the DB is not refreshed; the API serves the last-known conditions and
resumes on restart (the reconciler re-syncs via its existing full-resync path). If
the feedback→`Signal` path is disrupted, the design degrades to the existing
periodic full resync (correctness preserved, freshness reduced).

## UX Alignment

The `@temp-api` file `osac-ux/libs/ui-components/src/api/v1/baremetal-instance.ts`
imports the instance type from generated protobuf types and already exposes
`status.state` and `status.conditions` (each condition carrying `type`, `status`,
`lastTransitionTime`, `reason`, `message`). **This EP adds no new fields to that
type** — the UI reads the `reason`/`message` that already exist on
`status.conditions[]`. No `pnpm gen-types` migration is required for new fields;
the only UI work is the new progress view that computes the steps from existing
condition data.

| UI field (`@temp-api` TypeScript) | Proto field | Notes / deviation |
|---|---|---|
| `status.conditions[].type` | `status.conditions[].type` | Unchanged; UI matches `PROVISIONED` / `READY` |
| `status.conditions[].reason` | `status.conditions[].reason` | Unchanged field; now carries the fixed stage vocabulary while provisioning |
| `status.conditions[].message` | `status.conditions[].message` | Unchanged field; now carries curated stage/failure prose |
| `status.conditions[].lastTransitionTime` | `status.conditions[].last_transition_time` | Unchanged; marks the current stage's transition (no per-phase history) |
| `status.state` | `status.state` | Unchanged; still drives the coarse status label |

No known anti-patterns apply: the change is read-only observed state carried on
existing condition fields — no sub-resource action, string-union storage class,
K8s-internal field, one-time secret, or RHOAI operator field.

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

#### No schema change

There is intentionally **no** proto or CRD change. The design uses the existing
`BareMetalInstanceCondition{ type, status, last_transition_time, reason, message }`
[Codebase:
fulfillment-service/proto/private/osac/private/v1/baremetal_instance_type.proto]
and the existing operator lifecycle conditions [Codebase:
bare-metal-fulfillment-operator/api/v1alpha1/baremetalinstance_types.go]. This is
the central simplification over the earlier two-array design and the reason the
change is additive and low-risk. The only new code artifact is the pure
`DeriveProvisioningProgress` function (and its small result type) in the operator's
`api/v1alpha1` package — no generated type changes, so no `make manifests generate`.

#### Reconciler stage derivation

The condition→stage mapping is a pure function,
`DeriveProvisioningProgress(conds []metav1.Condition) ProvisioningProgress`, owned
by the bare-metal-fulfillment-operator and co-located with its `HostCondition*`
constants in `api/v1alpha1`. The fulfillment reconciler's `syncStatus()` calls it
and applies presentation. Placing the mapping in the operator keeps the semantics
of the conditions next to their definitions (the operator is the *technical
interface*; fulfillment is the *presentation layer*) and lets an exhaustiveness
test guard the contract at the source (IC-6). The function returns the derived
stage plus `provisioned` / `ready` / `failed` (with a fixed failure
classification); `syncStatus()` maps that result onto the proto conditions. The
mapping mirrors the CaaS `applyProgressingStageDetail` pattern [Codebase:
osac-operator/internal/controller/feedback_controller.go]:

- Inside the function, a fixed, ordered stage list keyed off the operator's
  existing lifecycle conditions; the **furthest-advanced** True condition selects
  the stage, so the result is order-independent (does not depend on the order
  conditions appear in the CR).
- While `PROVISIONED` is not yet `True`, `syncStatus()` sets its `reason` to the
  current stage value and its `message` to the curated string for that stage.
- When all provisioning/network conditions are True, `PROVISIONED` is set `True`
  with the terminal `Provisioned` reason/message.
- When the instance is available (powered-on ready), `READY` is set `True` with
  the `Ready` reason/message.
- On a failing condition/job, the relevant condition is set `False` with the fixed
  failure `reason` and its IC-5 `message`.

`sanitizeConditionMessage` is extended to return curated text for the in-progress
stages (today it returns a message only for `status == True`), so a provisioning
instance carries a non-empty `message`. The reconciler owns the curated message
vocabulary (presentation), while the operator function owns the condition→stage /
failure classification (technical interface) — a single, testable source on each
side, exactly as CaaS humanizes stage reasons in one function.

Current mis-wiring being fixed: `PROVISIONED` is set `True` with an empty
`reason`/`message` when `HostConditionProvisionTemplateComplete == True`, and
`READY` is set with empty `reason`/`message` [Codebase:
baremetalinstance_reconciler_function.go]. After this change, `PROVISIONED`
carries the stage progression and flips `True` at true provisioning completion,
and `READY` carries its terminal message.

#### Phase-to-backend-signal mapping

The reconciler derives each user-facing step from an authoritative operator
condition; metal3 exposes no per-step provisioning signal beyond the coarse BMH
state, and the AAP `JobStatus.Timestamp` is trigger-only, so the operator's
lifecycle conditions are the authoritative source.

| Step | Condition/Signal (furthest-advanced True) | Surfaced as |
|---|---|---|
| Host Allocation | `Allocated` (operator host search) | `PROVISIONED` reason `HostAllocation` (before `Allocated`) → step done at `Allocated` |
| Provisioning | single `osac-create-bare-metal-instance` AAP job → `ProvisionTemplateComplete` | `PROVISIONED` reason `Provisioning` |
| Network Setup | `NetworkAttachmentsReady` → `NetworkHandoffComplete` → `IPDiscoveryComplete` | `PROVISIONED` reason `NetworkSetup`; on completion `PROVISIONED` `True` |
| Ready | `PowerSynced` → instance available (absorbs readiness/verification) | `READY` `True`, reason `Ready` |

The happy-path sequence below shows what triggers each condition update — the
metal3 `BareMetalHost` and the AAP job templates the operator drives — and how the
fulfillment reconciler folds the **furthest-advanced True** lifecycle condition
into the single `PROVISIONED` `reason` (and, at completion, into `READY`). Only the
success path is shown; failure (a driving condition/job error setting its condition
`False`) and no-work / skipped stages are covered in the behavior notes below, not
here.

This second diagram is the source-side counterpart to the UI-to-backend flow
above: it details the backend triggers that advance the conditions, whereas the
first shows how those advances reach the user. The reconciler never invents a
stage — each `PROVISIONED` `reason` is a pure function of which lifecycle
conditions are True, selected order-independently, exactly as CaaS derives its
`PROGRESSING` reason.

Behavior for the cases the PRD asks the design to define [PRD: Assumptions]:

- **Milestone vs. running:** each of the four steps is derived from the current
  stage; Host Allocation is short but is shown running while host search is
  underway. There are no separate point-in-time milestones in this iteration
  (those belonged to the deferred deprovisioning timeline).
- **No work to do (e.g. no network attachment):** the reconciler treats a stage
  with no work as already satisfied — the derivation advances past it (the
  furthest-advanced True condition already reflects completion), so the instance
  never lingers on `NetworkSetup` when there is nothing to attach. The UI shows
  that step as complete rather than leaving it stuck. (A distinct `SKIPPED` state
  is not modelled, since there is no per-phase state field.)
- **Retried:** retries within a stage (the AAP job) do not change the derived
  stage; `PROVISIONED` stays on that stage's `reason` until the driving condition
  reaches its terminal state. Sub-retry detail is not surfaced (no log access, per
  Non-Goals).
- **Overlapping / collapsed:** OS install and configuration both run inside the
  single provision job and are attributed to the single **Provisioning** stage;
  the user always sees a strictly ordered sequence.

#### Reconciler and freshness

Freshness reuses the existing feedback path rather than adding a new watch. The
osac-operator already runs a feedback controller that watches the hub
`BareMetalInstance` CRs and rings fulfillment via a `Signal(id)` RPC when their
status changes; that signal triggers the fulfillment reconciler to re-read the CR
and update the DB within seconds [Research: loop-back Domain 8]. Because the stage
is carried on condition `reason`/`message`, an advancing stage **is** a status
change, so it already flows through this path — this design adds no new informer,
watch, or polling loop, and only confirms the `Signal` fires on
`reason`/`message` transitions. The existing periodic full resync is retained as a
correctness backstop.

#### Persistence and retention

The fulfillment DB stores the instance's proto status as JSON, so the last-written
conditions — including the terminal `READY`/`PROVISIONED` reason/message or a
failure `reason`/`message` — survive CR deletion and are served read-only for
completed and failed instances, and for released instances **for the life of the
fulfillment instance record**. This satisfies "which stage the instance reached
or failed at, and why, remains viewable after completion" (FR-4, re-scoped). The
**full ordered per-phase history with durations is not retained** — that durable
timeline is deferred (see Deferred / Follow-up work). On release the operator
removes the CR's finalizer; fulfillment then soft-deletes and archives the record
to `archived_<table>`, after which the public `GET` returns 404 (there is no
archive-read path) [Research: loop-back Domain 9].

#### UI

The instance detail view (osac-ui) adds a read-only progress view derived from
the same conditions the API already serves. Its inputs and behavior are the
contract this design fixes; its concrete visual and interaction design is deferred
to a UI-focused design (see Open Questions), so the following describes *what* it
derives, not *how* it is laid out.

Derivation of each of the four fixed steps from the conditions:

- Steps before the current stage are complete.
- The current stage (from `PROVISIONED.reason`, while `PROVISIONED` is not `True`)
  is in progress.
- Steps after the current stage are not yet started.
- On a failing condition, the failing step is marked failed and carries the
  curated `message`.
- `PROVISIONED` `True` but `READY` not yet `True` (provisioning finished, awaiting
  the powered-on ready state) → Host Allocation, Provisioning, and Network Setup
  are complete and the **Ready** step is the current in-progress step.
- `PROVISIONED` `True` + `READY` `True` → all steps complete.

The current or failed step shows the curated `message`; **no per-step duration is
shown** (deferred). The view is read-only (no actions). It auto-refreshes on a
dedicated ~5s interval while the instance is non-terminal (a per-page override of
the global ~10s default) and **stops refreshing once the instance is terminal** —
`READY` `True`, or a provisioning condition `False` with a failure reason
[Codebase: osac-ui/apps/app-frontend/src/main.tsx]. The same view renders the
persisted terminal/failure state for finished instances. Presentation details such
as component choice, step layout, iconography/coloring, and accessibility
affordances (e.g. a live region announcing refresh-driven changes) are left to the
UI-focused design.

### Security Considerations

This feature inherits the existing security model without changes. The
`reason`/`message` content is observed state exposed through the same read path
and authorization as the rest of `BareMetalInstanceStatus`; a caller who can `GET`
the instance can see its conditions, and no new mutating surface is added (the
view is read-only per Non-Goals). No user input reaches the `reason`/`message`.
The human-readable failure messages are drawn from a fixed reconciler-defined
vocabulary and deliberately exclude raw internal errors [PRD: In Scope], avoiding
leaking implementation detail across the tenant boundary.

### Failure Handling and Recovery

- **A provisioning stage fails.** The reconciler sets the relevant condition
  `False` with a fixed failure `reason` and curated `message` and stops advancing;
  the UI marks that step as failed. Later steps remain not-yet-started.
  Recovery is out of scope (read-only) — the user deletes and re-orders.
- **Operator down mid-stage.** The CR stops advancing; the DB serves the last
  conditions. On restart the operator resumes reconciliation and the derived stage
  continues.
- **Fulfillment reconciler restarts mid-reconcile.** The condition write is
  idempotent; on restart the reconciler re-syncs via its existing full-resync
  path, converging the DB to the current CR.
- **Feedback→`Signal` path disrupted.** Freshness degrades to the existing
  periodic full resync; conditions are still eventually consistent and no data is
  lost.
- **A stage has no work to do.** The derivation advances past it (see the mapping
  notes), so the instance never gets stuck on an inapplicable stage.

### RBAC / Tenancy

No tenancy or RBAC changes are required. The change only populates existing
condition fields on an existing tenant-scoped resource, served through the same
authorization path; visibility follows the instance's existing tenant scoping. No
new resources are introduced, and the reconciler writes only to the DB as it does
today (there is no write-back to the CR in this iteration — that was part of the
deferred deprovisioning handshake), so no new `patch` permission on the hub is
needed. Existing `osac.openshift.io/tenant` / `osac.openshift.io/owner-reference`
metadata on `BareMetalInstance` is unaffected [Codebase:
bare-metal-fulfillment-operator/api/v1alpha1/baremetalinstance_types.go].

### Observability and Monitoring

No new Prometheus metrics or alerts are introduced. The operator continues to
emit Kubernetes events on condition transitions via existing condition-change
event recording; the stage is observable through the API conditions and CR status.
A per-stage "stalled" metric is a natural follow-up but is out of scope — the
`PROVISIONED.lastTransitionTime` already makes the time-in-current-stage derivable
later without a schema change.

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Changing `PROVISIONED` semantics.** Moving `PROVISIONED` from a
  `ProvisionTemplateComplete`-driven ratchet to a stage-carrying condition that
  flips `True` at full provisioning completion could affect any consumer that read
  its old timing. Mitigation: `PROVISIONED` still flips `True` on the happy path
  and only its `reason`/`message` and exact True-instant change; the coarse
  `state` enum (the primary consumer signal) is unchanged. Audit current
  `PROVISIONED` readers during implementation.
- **Reason/message vs. coarse state divergence.** Mitigation: the reconciler
  derives the stage in one place from the operator conditions, so the stage and
  the coarse `state` cannot drift.
- **CR-condition change silently breaking the proto stage.** Because the derived
  proto `reason` is a function of the operator's CR conditions, a CR condition that
  is added, renamed, or removed can silently break the surfaced stage — and the two
  live in different packages/repos. Mitigation: the mapping is **one pure function
  co-located with the condition constants** in the operator package, and an
  **exhaustiveness test** (IC-6) enumerates the `HostCondition*` constants and
  fails if any is unclassified, so the break surfaces as a failing operator unit
  test in the same change that edits the conditions — not as a runtime regression
  in the proto. This mirrors CaaS's tested `applyProgressingStageDetail` but moves
  the mapping to the side that owns the conditions.
- **Refresh cost.** Bounded to a single-instance GET on an open detail page while
  non-terminal (~5s poll), stopping at terminal.

### Drawbacks

Reusing a single coarse condition means the API retains only the *current* stage,
not an ordered history — so this iteration cannot show a per-phase timeline with
durations. This is an accepted trade-off: it ships the consistent, low-risk core
now (matching CaaS), and the durable timeline is a deferred follow-up for which
the per-stage `lastTransitionTime` is already a foundation. In exchange the design
adds no new proto/CRD fields, no new persistence, and no new freshness path.

## Alternatives (Not Implemented)

- **Two ordered phase-array status fields (`provisioning_phases` /
  `deprovisioning_phases`) — the earlier draft of this design.** Model each phase
  as an entry in a new `repeated BareMetalInstancePhaseProgress` field, with new
  enums, a CRD struct, and a reconciler-gated finalizer handshake for the terminal
  Released instant. Pros: full ordered history with per-phase durations, retained
  across teardown. Cons: substantial net-new API surface (two fields, two enums, a
  message, a CRD struct) with **no VMaaS/CaaS precedent** — and it re-introduces
  exactly the multi-stage-status shape that CaaS's OSAC-4441 (PR #646) paid down
  in favour of a single order-independent progress condition. Rejected in favour
  of consistency; the durable ordered timeline is deferred as a follow-up rather
  than built as a BMaaS-specific construct.
- **One `metav1.Condition` per phase.** Model each phase as its own condition
  type. Cons: conditions are a semantically unordered set, so multiple
  lifecycle-coupled condition types bloat the shared conditions table, provide no
  ordering, and break coarse-status consistency. Rejected — the single
  `PROVISIONED` reason/message covers current-step consistency.
- **Dedicated progress CRD or DB history table.** A separate resource/table for
  the timeline. Cons: no OSAC precedent, new CRD/proto/RPC + DB migration + second
  fetch path, disproportionate. Rejected; the deferred durable-timeline follow-up
  can revisit persistence if a full history is later required.
- **Shortened global reconciler `SyncInterval`, or a new hub-side watch, for
  freshness.** Cons: unnecessary — the osac-operator feedback controller already
  Signals fulfillment on CR status change and delivers seconds-level freshness
  today [Research: loop-back Domain 8]. Rejected: this design reuses the existing
  `Signal` path.

Placement of the condition→stage derivation was also weighed (this design puts it
in an operator-owned shared function):

- **Derivation authored and executed entirely in the fulfillment reconciler (no
  shared function).** Keep the mapping as private code in `syncStatus`, reading the
  operator's condition constants directly (an earlier shape of this design). Pros:
  one component to change; no new exported operator surface. Cons: the mapping
  lives in a different repo from the conditions it interprets, so a CR condition
  rename/removal only breaks at runtime (an empty or wrong proto `reason`), with no
  co-located-test signal. Rejected in favour of an operator-owned shared function
  so the contract and its exhaustiveness test sit next to the conditions (IC-6).
- **Operator writes a coarse `Provisioned`/`Ready` CR condition; fulfillment copies
  it verbatim (VMaaS-style).** VMaaS's `ComputeInstance` CR conditions already match
  the proto vocabulary 1:1, so its feedback controller copies them directly. Cons:
  BMaaS's CR conditions are deliberately fine-grained (`Allocated`,
  `ProvisionTemplateComplete`, `NetworkAttachmentsReady`, `IPDiscoveryComplete`,
  `NetworkHandoffComplete`, `PowerSynced`); collapsing them into a coarse
  `Provisioned`/`Ready` CR condition would add a CRD field, require
  `make manifests generate`, and duplicate state the fine-grained conditions
  already carry. Rejected — the aggregation is derivation, not storage; the shared
  function performs it without a CRD change.
- **Convert BMaaS status feedback from pull to push (feedback `Bridge`).** Make the
  osac-operator BMI feedback controller derive the stage and push it to fulfillment
  via a gRPC `Update`, as CaaS/VMaaS do with `feedback.Bridge`, instead of the
  fulfillment reconciler pulling the CR. Pros: co-locates derivation with the
  operator that watches the CR. Cons: a substantially larger change — it reworks the
  BMaaS status path (today the osac-operator BMI feedback controller is
  `Signal`-only and fulfillment pulls) and gives up the existing, working pull path
  for no functional gain here. Rejected for scope; the shared function gets the
  ownership benefit without changing the transport.

## Open Questions

- **Visual and interaction design of the UI progress view.** This design fixes the
  data contract (the four steps derived from `PROVISIONED` `reason` / `READY`), the
  read-only behavior, the ~5s auto-refresh with stop-at-terminal, and the curated
  failure messages, but intentionally leaves the concrete UI — component choice,
  layout, per-step presentation, and accessibility affordances — to a separate
  UI-focused design (owner: @rawagner). Raised in review of PR #268.

Resolved during review: the earlier open question about the `PROVISIONED`
True-instant (flip at `ProvisionTemplateComplete` vs. at full provisioning
completion) is settled in favor of flipping at full provisioning completion, per
the proposal; the change to that one condition's exact True-instant is tracked as
a risk with an implementation-time audit of current `PROVISIONED` readers (see
Risks and Mitigations). The coarse `state` is unaffected.

## Test Plan

**Note:** *Section not required until targeted at a release.* Concrete scenarios,
mapped to the requirement/interface-change matrix, are enumerated in
`testplan.md`.

### Unit Tests

- Stage-derivation function (`DeriveProvisioningProgress`, bare-metal-fulfillment-operator):
  each operator lifecycle-condition / AAP job-status fixture maps to the correct
  stage / terminal / failure result, selecting the furthest-advanced stage
  order-independently; provisioning-complete and ready are reported at the right
  instants.
- Derivation exhaustiveness (operator, IC-6): a test enumerates the exported
  `HostCondition*` constants and fails if any is neither mapped nor explicitly
  listed as not-surfaced, so a CR-condition change that would break the proto stage
  fails here first.
- `syncStatus` presentation (fulfillment): the derived stage is stamped onto
  `PROVISIONED.reason`/`message`, `PROVISIONED` flips `True` at completion and
  `READY` `True` at readiness.
- `sanitizeConditionMessage`: returns the curated in-progress message for each
  stage and never emits raw error text.
- Failure vocabulary: each failure reason produces its defined human-readable
  message and no raw error text.

### Integration Tests

- envtest: driving a `BareMetalInstance` CR through Host Allocation →
  Provisioning → Network Setup → Ready produces the expected `PROVISIONED`
  reason/message progression and a terminal `READY` `True`.
- Feedback→`Signal` path: a CR condition change (reason/message) triggers a DB
  sync within seconds (fulfillment reconciler against a kind cluster).
- Persistence: after CR deletion, the API still serves the last terminal/failure
  conditions up to record archival.

### E2E Tests

- pytest (`tests/e2e/`): order a bare metal instance and assert the API exposes
  the advancing `PROVISIONED` reason and terminal `READY`.
- osac-ui (Vitest + RTL / Cypress): the detail view renders the progress view with
  the correct per-step state for not-started/in-progress/complete/failed, shows a
  failure message on a failed step, exposes no retry control, and updates on
  refresh.

## Graduation Criteria

Graduation criteria will be finalized when targeting a release; the measurable
gates per stage are:

- **Dev Preview:** `PROVISIONED` reason/message advances end-to-end for the happy
  path; stage-derivation unit tests cover every operator condition / AAP
  job-status fixture; the UI progress view renders the four steps against a kind
  cluster.
- **Tech Preview:** all testplan cases pass (FR-1…FR-5, NFR-1…NFR-3), including
  the failure (FR-5/IC-5) and freshness (TC-NFR1-01) scenarios; NFR-1 freshness is
  verified to meet single-digit seconds via the feedback→`Signal` path in e2e; no
  regression in the coarse `state`/`conditions` layer.
- **GA:** the feature has run in a production-representative deployment across at
  least one full provisioning cycle without the derived stage diverging from the
  CR, and the failure-message vocabulary has been reviewed with support.

**Documentation.** User-facing change is limited to the instance detail view; the
new progress view needs a short help/legend entry (step meanings, states). There
is **no** API-surface documentation change (no new fields/endpoints) — the
`reason`/`message` fields are already documented on the condition. No runbook
change beyond the Support notes below.

## Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

This changes only the content of existing status fields; there is no schema
migration. On upgrade, existing instances get enriched `reason`/`message` on their
next reconcile; older readers that ignore `reason`/`message` see unchanged
behavior via the coarse `state`. Downgrade is safe: an older reconciler simply
writes the previous empty-reason conditions again on its next reconcile — the
content is derived state, re-derivable from the CR.

## Version Skew Strategy

The stage is derived entirely by the fulfillment reconciler from the operator's
existing conditions, so operator/reconciler skew is tolerated: an older reconciler
writes empty-reason conditions (existing behavior); a newer reconciler reading an
older operator's CR derives the stage from whatever lifecycle conditions are
present. No new fields and no CRD version migration are involved.

## Support Procedures

- **Detection:** a stalled stage (`PROVISIONED.reason` unchanged past expected
  duration) indicates a backend stall; for the Provisioning stage, correlate with
  operator logs and the `osac-create-bare-metal-instance` AAP job status. A stage
  that never updates in the UI while the CR advances indicates a feedback-path or
  reconciler problem — check the fulfillment reconciler logs and `Signal`/DB-sync
  events.
- **Disabling:** the feature has no feature gate; to suppress the UI, the progress
  view can be hidden without backend changes. The enriched `reason`/`message`
  are inert if unread. Disabling has no effect on provisioning itself (observation
  only).
- **Recovery:** restarting the fulfillment reconciler re-syncs CRs via its
  existing full-resync path and reconverges the DB; consistency is maintained
  because the conditions are a full-replace derived projection of the CR.

## Infrastructure Needed

None. Existing repositories, CI, and test infrastructure (envtest, kind, pytest
e2e) cover the change.
