# BMaaS Networking — Switch Port Configuration and Tenant-Defined Interface Mapping

BMaaS networking provides single-NIC BaremetalInstance provisioning with optional tenant-specified physical interface mapping, switch port configuration via dispatcher, IP address feedback through CR status, and auto-provisioned external access (ExternalIP).

## Summary

This document is a per-service expansion of the [Unified Networking EP](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md). The unified EP defines the shared architecture and [deployment support boundary](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#deployment-support-boundary); BMaaS networking supports connected deployments only and does not add air-gapped or disconnected networking support. This document defines how BMaaS consumes that architecture.
Networking resources support only Create, List/Get, and Delete, and
`BaremetalInstance` network attachment fields are immutable after creation;
changes require delete and recreate.

BMaaS networking also inherits the [Unified Networking hub support
boundary](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#networking-hub-support-boundary):
OSAC networking supports exactly one provider-owned hub per deployment.
Multi-hub networking placement, cross-hub resource coordination, and
cross-hub network connectivity are unsupported. This boundary applies only to
the networking area and does not define hub behavior for other OSAC areas.
Multiple hosting/workload clusters remain supported where a networking feature
explicitly specifies them.

BaremetalInstance supports a repeated `BareMetalNetworkAttachment` field for API compatibility, but accepts at most one entry. The optional `interface` and `primary` fields retain their existing semantics; with one entry, `primary` is implicit, omission and `true` are accepted, and `false` is rejected. The bare-metal-fulfillment-operator's `reconcileNetworking` phase configures the switch port via dispatcher, and IP address feedback via CR status enables DNAT rule creation. See [PRD](prd.md) for detailed requirements.

## Motivation

Bare-metal servers require explicit switch port configuration to participate in the OSAC Networking API. Unlike VMs (which live inside an OVN overlay bridged to the fabric), BM servers connect directly to the physical fabric — each NIC's switch port must be moved between network segments during the provisioning lifecycle.

### Architecture: Two Operators on One CR

### Goals

**Core Design Goals (G1–G5):**

- **G1 — OS-agnostic host networking.** All host addressing via DHCP; no per-OS host-side config. Corollary: exactly one default route at any moment.
- **G2 — Provisioning connectivity.** During inspect + deploy the server can reach its image source and the Ironic conductor.
- **G3 — Correct, minimal final state.** After provisioning: attached to exactly one tenant network segment, single default route, no residual provisioning network.
- **G4 — Isolated until ready.** The tenant reaches the server only after it is fully provisioned and in its final network state; provisioning traffic is never exposed to the tenant.
- **G5 — Achievable on stock metal3 + fabric manager today.**

**Implementation Goals:**

- Single-NIC support with optional physical interface mapping (tenant specifies one interface name from BareMetalInstanceType)
- Resource-specific attachment message (`BareMetalNetworkAttachment`) with `interface` and `primary` fields
- Optional `network_attachments` field — populate with tenant defaults when omitted
- Auto ExternalIP attachment (`auto_external_ip_attachment`) for single-call inbound connectivity
- bare-metal-fulfillment-operator `reconcileNetworking` phase: dispatcher moves the selected interface's fabric port onto the tenant subnet's network segment (provisioning network → tenant) via the generic `move_network_attachment` role
- Provisioning network: an idle (unassigned) server keeps its fabric NIC on an OSAC-owned provisioning network (DHCP + gateway + SNAT) so it has internet during metal3 inspection; provisioning moves the port provisioning network → tenant, deletion moves it tenant → provisioning network (see [Provisioning Network and Port Moves](#provisioning-network-and-port-moves))
- IP discovery after provisioning: operator queries fabric manager's DHCP lease API via dispatcher (`query_dhcp_lease` role), matches the port MAC (resolved from the BareMetalHost `osac.openshift.io/interface-macs` annotation) to the DHCP-assigned IP, writes to CR status, feedback controller syncs to fulfillment-service, ExternalIPAttachment controller reads primary IP for DNAT
- BareMetalInstanceType `network_ports` list with structured port definitions (name, role, type, speed)
- Remove unused `networkClass` field from BareMetalInstance spec entirely (unused per reviewer feedback)

### The Three Network Planes

BMaaS involves three planes; this design owns only the data-plane ones. Do not conflate them.

| Plane | Carries | OS sees it? | Fabric-managed? | Owned by |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **BMC / OOB** | Redfish/IPMI: power, virtual-media | Depends on wiring (dedicated port: no; shared-LOM: yes, own VLAN) | Not for now (separate mgmt network) | metal3 (prerequisite) |
| **Provisioning network** | host DHCP, image download, IPA→conductor callback | Yes (in-band, fabric NIC) | **Yes** | this design |
| **Tenant network** | tenant workload | Yes (fabric NIC after handoff) | Yes | this design |

"OOB" refers only to the BMC plane. The provisioning network is **in-band** (the OS/IPA uses it) — never call it OOB.

**Note on terminology:** In the current code and configuration, the provisioning network is identified as `netris_bm_parking_vnet`. This identifier is retained for deployment stability; the docs-only rename to "provisioning network" clarifies its purpose without requiring immediate config changes.

#### Connectivity Paths

| Path | Network |
|------|---------|
| Ironic → BMC (power/virtual-media) | mgmt/BMC network; conductor routes to BMC IPs |
| IPA → Ironic (callback) | provisioning network |
| Image download | provisioning network → local mirror (or internet) |
| Tenant DHCP + lease discovery | tenant network (fabric manager) |
| Fabric-port network move | fabric manager |

Ironic reaching two planes at once is ordinary **multi-homing**: the conductor host has a NIC/route to each network; it listens on all interfaces for inbound callbacks and the kernel selects egress NIC + source IP per destination. Which network carries the callback is set by the metal3 **`Provisioning` CR** (`provisioningNetwork`, `provisioningIP`/`provisioningInterface`, `virtualMediaViaExternalNetwork`), and each BMC address is per-host on the `BareMetalHost` (`spec.bmc.address`) — none of this is OSAC operator code.

### Non-Goals

- CaaS or VMaaS networking (this EP covers BMaaS only)
- Dispatcher infrastructure implementation (deferred to Unified Networking EP implementation)
- Creating the provisioning network (network segment + DHCP + gateway + SNAT) and the initial per-server attach — a deployment prerequisite handled by the fabric infrastructure / deployment infrastructure, not the operator (see [Provisioning Network and Port Moves](#provisioning-network-and-port-moves))
- Re-provision handoff reset: NetworkHandoffComplete is never reset after initial provisioning, so an in-place re-provision (config-version change after Ready) would run over the tenant network (deferred to long-term design)

## Proposal

### BareMetalInstanceType and Interface Validation

#### BareMetalInstanceType Network Ports

The `BareMetalInstanceType` resource in the fulfillment-service (OSAC-1201) describes a class of bare-metal hardware. For networking, BareMetalInstanceTypes include a structured network ports list:

```protobuf
message BareMetalNetworkPortSpec {
  string name = 1;        // e.g., "data-0", "data-1", "mgmt-0"
  string role = 2;        // e.g., "fabric", "management", "storage", "lifecycle"
  string type = 3;        // e.g., "Ethernet"
  string speed = 4;       // e.g., "100Gbps", "1Gbps"
}
```

`BareMetalInstanceType` is a bare-metal-only resource (OSAC-1201) — BM vs VM is classified by resource type (`BareMetalInstance` vs `ComputeInstance`), not by the contents of `network_ports`. Every `BareMetalInstanceType` must declare at least one `network_ports` entry with `role=fabric`; a bare-metal profile with no fabric port is rejected at creation time because both the operator (provisioning-network port move) and the default-interface resolution (first `role=fabric` port) depend on it. Canonical port-role validation (rejecting unknown or misspelled role values) is owned by OSAC-1201's BareMetalInstanceType schema.

Interfaces are ordered. When multiple interfaces share the same role, the first one in the list is the default for that role (used by CaaS for automatic resolution — see CaaS design).

**Interface-name identity contract.** `BareMetalNetworkAttachment.interface` selects a port by `BareMetalNetworkPortSpec.name`. The operator passes this name as `logical_interface_name` to `move_network_attachment`, and the `osac.openshift.io/interface-macs` annotation keys use the same name. These three identifiers — catalog port name, fabric-manager logical interface, and interface-macs annotation key — must be consistent; a mismatch causes the port move or DHCP lease query to target the wrong NIC. Inventory tooling and BareMetalInstanceType registration must align on the same naming convention.

#### How BMaaS Uses BareMetalInstanceType

The tenant provides `BareMetalNetworkAttachment` with an explicit `interface` field referencing a port `name` from the BareMetalInstanceType's `network_ports` list. The fulfillment-service validates:
- The `interface` name exists in the BareMetalInstanceType's `network_ports` list
- The BareMetalInstanceType is resolved from the instance's `instance_type` field

Unlike CaaS (which picks the interface automatically by role), BMaaS gives the tenant direct control over which physical interface maps to which subnet.

#### BareMetalInstanceType as the Authoritative Model

The [BareMetalInstanceType EP](/enhancements/OSAC-1201-baremetal-instance-types) provides the tenant-facing hardware catalog for BMaaS, with full hardware specs and network port definitions (name, role, type, speed). Per [OSAC-2135 (CaaS Bare-Metal Worker Node Provisioning)](/enhancements/OSAC-2135-caas-bare-metal-worker-provisioning/design.md), `HostType` is deprecated and decommissioned — `BareMetalInstanceType` is now the sole source of truth for hardware profiles and interface resolution:

- BMaaS tenants discover available interfaces via the BareMetalInstanceType API (with type + speed info)
- Interface validation uses BareMetalInstanceType's `network_ports` list
- CaaS fulfillment resolves the fabric interface from `BareMetalInstanceType.network_ports[].role=fabric` at cluster creation and stores it on the node set
- `BareMetalInstanceType.host_label_selector` provides direct inventory matching (OSAC-1201), replacing the former HostType reverse lookup

> **CaaS network attachment source:** For CaaS bare-metal workers, the network attachment originates from the private `ClusterOrder.spec.networkAttachment` (`ClusterNetworkAttachment`) and is enriched per-BMI by the `BareMetalWorkerReconciler` with the immutable `fabric_interface` already resolved and stored on the node set during cluster creation. See [OSAC-2135](/enhancements/OSAC-2135-caas-bare-metal-worker-provisioning/design.md) for the full enrichment flow.

#### Interface Role Convention

| Role | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `fabric` | Primary fabric traffic (east-west, tenant workloads) |
| `management` | In-band management/control plane traffic |
| `storage` | Storage fabric traffic |
| `lifecycle` | Out-of-band lifecycle management (PXE boot, Redfish/BMC) |

Roles are conventions, not enforced enums. BMaaS uses them for display/documentation; the tenant selects by port name, not role. Ports with role `lifecycle` are used by the provisioning system (Ironic, Metal3) for PXE boot and BMC operations — they are NOT tenant-attachable and should not appear in `network_attachments`.

### Workflow Description

#### Phase 1: Tenant Creates Networking Resources

Same as VMaaS/CaaS — the networking API is uniform.

1. **Create VirtualNetwork:**
   ```bash
   osac create virtualnetwork --network-class moc --cidr 10.0.0.0/16 --name my-net
   ```
   Dispatcher → `osac.templates.{{ fabric_manager }}.create_virtual_network`

2. **Create Subnet:**
   ```bash
   osac create subnet --virtual-network my-net --cidr 10.0.1.0/24 --name my-subnet
   ```
   Dispatcher → fabric_manager creates VLAN/fabric segment. If the NetworkClass has a k8s_manager: also creates CUDN overlay (but BM doesn't use it — the overlay exists for VMs that may share the same subnet).

3. **Create SecurityGroup:**
   ```bash
   osac create security-group --virtual-network my-net --name my-sg \
     --ingress "protocol:tcp,port:443,source:0.0.0.0/0"
   ```
   Dispatcher → `osac.templates.{{ fabric_manager }}.create_security_group`

#### Phase 2: Tenant Creates BM Server

4. **Create BaremetalInstance with network_attachments:**

   Single interface (simple case):
   ```bash
   osac create baremetalinstance --template bcm_h100 \
     --network-attachment interface=data-0,subnet=my-subnet,security-groups=my-sg \
     --name my-server
   ```

   A second `--network-attachment` flag is rejected; multi-NIC BMaaS is not
   supported.

   With defaults + auto external access:
   ```bash
   osac create baremetalinstance --template bcm_h100 \
     --external-ip-attachment --name my-server
   ```

   After provisioning completes, `osac get baremetalinstance` shows the discovered internal IP:
   ```
   ID          NAME       CATALOG ITEM   STATE    INTERNAL IP
   01a0...     my-server  ci-bm-default  RUNNING  10.100.0.2
   ```

5. **fulfillment-service:**
   - If `network_attachments` is omitted or empty: populates the sole attachment with the tenant's default Subnet, default SecurityGroup, and the first port with role `fabric` from `BareMetalInstanceType.network_ports` (see [Default Networking PRD](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-default-networking)).
   - If one attachment is supplied, defaults only missing fields: a missing Subnet receives the tenant default Subnet, a missing or empty SecurityGroup list receives the tenant default SecurityGroup only when the resolved Subnet belongs to the tenant's default VirtualNetwork, and a missing interface receives the first `fabric` port from `BareMetalInstanceType.network_ports`; supplied values are preserved.
   - Validates:
     - At most one network attachment is specified
     - Each subnet exists, is Ready
     - The subnet and each SecurityGroup belong to the same VirtualNetwork
     - The optional `interface` references a valid interface name from the BareMetalInstanceType's network ports list
     - If `interface` is omitted, defaults to the first port with `role=fabric` from the BareMetalInstanceType
     - If one attachment is present, it is the implicit primary; omitted or `primary: true` is accepted but redundant, while `primary: false` is rejected
   - If `auto_external_ip_attachment == true`: auto-selects ExternalIPPool (READY, most available capacity, matching IP family), creates ExternalIP (labeled `osac.openshift.io/auto-created: "true"` and `osac.openshift.io/auto-created-for: <baremetal-instance-id>`) + ExternalIPAttachment (labeled `osac.openshift.io/auto-created: "true"`) in the same DB transaction — both start in **Pending** state. The ExternalIPAttachment references the BaremetalInstance but does not yet have a DNAT target IP (the BM's IP is unknown until `reconcileNetworking` runs). Pool capacity is decremented atomically; if the pool is exhausted, the API call fails and no resources are persisted (including the BaremetalInstance). See [Unified Networking — Auto-provisioning lifecycle](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#external-access-same-for-all-resource-types) for the shared two-phase flow.
   - Creates BaremetalInstance CR with `network_attachments` in spec

6. **bare-metal-fulfillment-operator BareMetalInstance controller:**

   a. `reconcileInventory` (unchanged):
      - FindFreeHost → AssignHost (Ironic/Metal3)
      - Populates HostClass from inventory

   b. `reconcileProvisioning` (runs after inventory):
      - Triggers AAP job via `RunProvisioningLifecycle`
      - Template does OS provisioning (PXE boot, user-data, etc.)
      - Server stays on the provisioning network during this phase
      - Host-side networking is handled by DHCP — the template does NOT configure static IPs, gateway, or DNS. The host receives its IP automatically from the provisioning network DHCP server.

   c. **`reconcileNetworking` (runs after provisioning is complete):**
      - Reads `network_attachments` from the CR spec
      - **Operator dispatches switch-side config:** For the sole attachment, the operator dispatches the `osac-move-network-attachment` job, which resolves `subnetRef` → tenant network segment name and moves the server's selected fabric port **provisioning network → tenant network** via `osac.templates.{{ fabric_manager }}.move_network_attachment` (`host_name` = fabric server name from ExternalHostID, `logical_interface_name` = interface from the resolved attachment, `from_vnet_name` = provisioning network, `to_vnet_name` = tenant network segment). See [Provisioning Network and Port Moves](#provisioning-network-and-port-moves).
      - **Network segment readiness wait:** After each port attach, the move playbook polls the fabric manager until the target network segment reaches active/ready state. This ensures the switch fabric has fully converged before the operator triggers the handoff reboot — without this wait, the host may DHCP on the wrong network.
      - Sets condition: `NetworkAttachmentsReady=True`

   d. **`reconcileReboot` (runs after networking):**
      - Issues reboot via BareMetalHost annotation so the OS re-DHCPs on the tenant network
      - Waits for reboot to complete
      - Sets condition: `NetworkHandoffComplete=True`

   e. `reconcilePower` (unchanged)

7. **IP discovery and feedback (`reconcileIPDiscovery` — runs after reboot):**
   - After `reconcileReboot` completes and the host has received a DHCP lease on the tenant network, the operator queries the fabric manager's DHCP lease API via dispatcher (`osac.templates.{{ fabric_manager }}.query_dhcp_lease`). The role queries DHCP leases for the tenant subnet and matches the server's port MAC address (resolved from the BareMetalHost `osac.openshift.io/interface-macs` annotation — see [IP Discovery](#ip-discovery)) to find the corresponding DHCP-assigned IP on the tenant network.
   - Operator writes the discovered IP to `status.networkAttachmentStatuses[].ipAddress` on the BaremetalInstance CR
   - Feedback controller watches CR status changes → fires Signal RPC to fulfillment-service
   - fulfillment-service reconciler syncs the discovered IP to the DB via existing `syncStatus()` pattern

#### Phase 3: External Access (optional)

8. **Create ExternalIP:**
   ```bash
   osac create externalip --pool external-pool-1 --name my-ip
   ```
   Dispatcher → `osac.templates.{{ fabric_manager }}.create_external_ip`

9. **Create ExternalIPAttachment:**
    ```bash
    osac create externalipattachment --externalip my-ip \
      --baremetal-instance my-server --name bm-att
    ```
    - ExternalIPAttachment controller resolves the BaremetalInstance target by UUID label
    - Checks two preconditions before dispatching (requeues if either is not met):
      1. **ExternalIP must be Allocated** (have an allocated address from the fabric manager)
      2. **BaremetalInstance must have a primary IP** — reads `status.networkAttachmentStatuses[].ipAddress` for the attachment where `primary: true`. This IP is written by the operator during `reconcileIPDiscovery` (step 7) and synced to the fulfillment-service via the feedback controller.
    - Once both preconditions are met: writes `osac.openshift.io/target-ip` annotation on the ExternalIPAttachment CR
    - Calls `osac.templates.{{ fabric_manager }}.create_external_ip_attachment`
    - Fabric manager creates DNAT rule: external IP → BM's primary subnet IP
    - ExternalIPAttachment transitions from Pending to Ready

    For auto-provisioned ExternalIPAttachments (`auto_external_ip_attachment=true`), the same flow applies — the attachment is created at API time in Pending state and the controller activates it once the BM's IP becomes known. The wait time depends on `reconcileIPDiscovery` completion (IP discovery by the operator after provisioning completes and the host has received a DHCP lease).

#### Deletion (reverse order)

10. **Delete BaremetalInstance:**
    - **Auto-provisioned cleanup (osac-operator):** The osac-operator adds a cleanup finalizer (`osac.openshift.io/baremetalinstance-cleanup`) on BaremetalInstance CRs that have `auto_external_ip_attachment=true`. On deletion, it performs the phased requeue cleanup: deletes ExternalIPAttachment first (by target reference), waits, then deletes ExternalIP (by `auto-created-for` label), waits, then removes its finalizer. See [Unified Networking — Auto-provisioned resource cleanup](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#external-access-same-for-all-resource-types) for the pattern. This runs concurrently with the bare-metal-fulfillment-operator's deletion flow but does not conflict (different CRs).
    - **Manually created resources are NOT cleaned up** — tenant manages their lifecycle.
    - **Default networking resources (VN, Subnet, SG, NATGateway) are NOT cleaned up** — tenant-scoped and shared.
    - bare-metal-fulfillment-operator (power-off-first ordering ensures tenant workloads **never** run on the provisioning network):
      - `reconcileNetworkOffboardShutdown`: powers off the host **while the port is still on the tenant network**, tracked by `NetworkOffboardComplete` condition. If the host is already powered off, this is a no-op. This guarantees the tenant workload stops before the port moves to the provisioning network.
      - `reconcileNetworking` (delete): dispatches the same `osac-move-network-attachment` job — because the CR now carries a `deletionTimestamp`, the playbook moves each port **tenant network → provisioning network** (`from_vnet_name` = tenant network segment, `to_vnet_name` = provisioning network), returning the fabric NIC to the provisioning network so the freed server keeps internet for its next inspection. The host is off at this point, so nothing runs on the provisioning network. A missing tenant Subnet CR is tolerated (detach skipped, port still returned to provisioning network).
      - `reconcileDeprovisioning`: triggers AAP delete job for OS teardown. Ironic powers the host back on via BMC and PXE-boots a cleaning ramdisk on the provisioning network — not the tenant OS.
      - Removes management finalizer
    - `reconcileInventory` deletion: UnassignHost from Ironic/Metal3, removes inventory finalizer
    - osac-operator feedback controller: waits for other finalizers, removes feedback finalizer, fires final Signal

11. **Tenant deletes networking resources** (independently):
    - Delete ExternalIPAttachments, ExternalIPs, SecurityGroup, Subnet, VirtualNetwork — each via its own dispatcher-triggered delete job

**BMaaS-specific deletion dependency guard:**

The Subnet controller gates its deprovision job on the complete removal
of all BareMetalInstance CRs with `spec.networkAttachments[].subnetRef`
referencing the subnet. This prevents the infrastructure backend from
rejecting the subnet deletion because bare-metal servers are still
attached to it. The guard lists BMI CRs in the namespace and filters by
`subnetRef` in-memory, requeuing every 10 seconds until all BMIs are gone.
See [Unified Networking — Deletion Dependency Guards](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#deletion-dependency-guards)
for the full guard table covering all networking resources.

**IP discovery lease validation:**

The IP discovery phase (`reconcileIPDiscovery`) requires that all network
attachments have a valid DHCP lease before marking `IPDiscoveryComplete=True`.
If the AAP `query_dhcp_lease` job returns no artifacts, or returns leases
that do not cover all attachments, the operator treats this as a failure
and backs off with exponential retry. A BareMetalInstance cannot reach
`Ready` phase (and therefore `RUNNING` state) without all attachment IPs
discovered. This prevents the scenario where a DHCP lease is not yet
available (e.g., the fabric manager's DHCP server has not propagated the
lease to the new network segment) and the BMI appears as RUNNING with
no internal IP.

### API Extensions

#### Proto (fulfillment-service)

```protobuf
message BareMetalNetworkAttachment {
  SubnetLocalReference subnet = 1;                         // Optional on input; immutable after resolution
  repeated SecurityGroupLocalReference security_groups = 2; // Optional on input; immutable after resolution
  string interface = 3;                 // optional, immutable: physical interface
                                        // from BareMetalInstanceType
  optional bool primary = 4;            // omitted or true: implicit default gateway; false is rejected
}

message BareMetalInstanceSpec {
  string catalog_item = 1;              // immutable
  optional string ssh_public_key = 2;   // immutable
  optional string user_data = 3;        // immutable
  optional BareMetalInstanceRunStrategy run_strategy = 4;
  int64 restart_trigger = 5;
  map<string, google.protobuf.Any> template_parameters = 6;  // immutable
  optional BareMetalInstanceImage image = 7;                  // immutable
  repeated BareMetalNetworkAttachment network_attachments = 8; // NEW, optional; max 1 for compatibility
  bool auto_external_ip_attachment = 9;  // NEW, auto-provision ExternalIP + ExternalIPAttachment
}

message BareMetalInstanceStatus {
  // ... existing fields ...
  repeated BareMetalNetworkAttachmentStatus network_attachment_statuses = N; // NEW
}

message BareMetalNetworkAttachmentStatus {
  string interface = 1;
  string subnet_ref = 2;
  string ip_address = 3;  // Discovered after DHCP assignment, synced to fulfillment-service via feedback
  bool primary = 4;       // true for the sole resolved attachment; normalized from spec
}
```

#### Operator CRD (bare-metal-fulfillment-operator)

```go
type BareMetalInstanceSpec struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    NetworkAttachments []BareMetalNetworkAttachment `json:"networkAttachments,omitempty"`
}

type BareMetalNetworkAttachment struct {
    SubnetRef         string   `json:"subnetRef"`
    SecurityGroupRefs []string `json:"securityGroupRefs,omitempty"`
    Interface         string   `json:"interface,omitempty"`
    Primary           bool     `json:"primary,omitempty"`
}

type BareMetalInstanceStatus struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    NetworkAttachmentStatuses []BareMetalNetworkAttachmentStatus `json:"networkAttachmentStatuses,omitempty"`
}

type BareMetalNetworkAttachmentStatus struct {
    Interface  string `json:"interface,omitempty"`
    SubnetRef  string `json:"subnetRef,omitempty"`
    IPAddress  string `json:"ipAddress,omitempty"` // Discovered after DHCP assignment
    Primary    bool   `json:"primary,omitempty"` // true for the sole resolved attachment
}
```

CEL immutability: the `network_attachments` list and every field in each
attachment are immutable after creation, including `subnetRef`,
`securityGroupRefs`, `interface`, and `primary`.

CEL validation rule:
```yaml
- rule: "self.networkAttachments.size() <= 1"
  message: "at most one network attachment is supported"
```

#### fulfillment-service Controller (mutateBMI)

The `mutateBMI()` function in the fulfillment-service's BM reconciler currently sets TemplateID, TemplateParameters, and RunStrategy on the K8s CR. It must also copy the sole `network_attachments` entry from the proto spec to the K8s CR spec. Before persistence, it normalizes the sole attachment to `primary: true` (the implicit-primary rule); a single attachment is never persisted with `primary: false`.

#### Server Validation Rules

- At most one network attachment may be specified
- An omitted or empty list receives the tenant defaults; a supplied single entry receives defaults only for missing fields
- The resolved subnet and security groups must belong to the same VirtualNetwork
- The `interface` must reference a valid port name from the BareMetalInstanceType (its network ports list defines available ports)
- Interfaces with role `lifecycle` are rejected in `network_attachments` — lifecycle interfaces (PXE boot, BMC) are reserved for the provisioning system and are not tenant-attachable
- If `interface` is omitted: defaults to the first port with `role=fabric` from the BareMetalInstanceType (consistent with the omitted-list default)
- If a single attachment is present: `primary` is implicit; omitted or `true` is accepted and `false` is rejected
- The complete resolved `network_attachments` list is immutable after creation; changing it requires deleting and recreating the BaremetalInstance

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

#### Provisioning Network and Port Moves

Bare-metal servers configure host-side networking entirely via DHCP. An
**unassigned** server (owned by no tenant) has no tenant network segment, so without
intervention it has no default gateway and no internet — which breaks the Ironic
Python Agent (IPA) during metal3 inspection/cleaning (it cannot download its
rootfs). Hanging the default gateway off the management/BMC NIC is not an option:
the host would then have two DHCP default routes (management + fabric) once a
tenant subnet is attached, causing a default-gateway race.

**Solution — a provisioning network.** A fabric manager **provisioning network
segment** (DHCP + default gateway + SNAT for outbound internet) holds every
server's **fabric NIC** while the server is idle and during provisioning, so an
unassigned server always has internet via its fabric NIC. The provisioning
network exists **only in the fabric manager** — it has no OSAC Subnet CR — and
its name is a fabric-manager configuration value (`netris_bm_provisioning_vnet`,
sourced from the `NETRIS_BM_PROVISIONING_VNET` environment variable, with
backward-compatible fallback to `NETRIS_BM_PARKING_VNET`), not operator state.

**Provision and deprovision are the same primitive: move a fabric port from one
network segment to another.** The port lifecycle is:

| Flow | Trigger | Move (from → to) | When |
|------|---------|------------------|------|
| Initial | Deployment bootstrap (deployment infrastructure) | — → provisioning network | Pre-deployment |
| Provision | BMI `reconcileNetworking` (after ProvisionTemplateComplete) | provisioning network → tenant subnet's network segment | **POST-provisioning** |
| Deprovision | BMI deletion (networking cleanup) | tenant subnet's network segment → provisioning network | Deletion |

**Key difference from the previous design:** The port move now happens **AFTER
provisioning is complete**, not before. The server is provisioned while on the
provisioning network, then moved to the tenant network and rebooted so the OS
re-DHCPs there. This achieves isolation-until-ready (G4): the tenant cannot reach
the server during imaging/first-boot, and provisioning traffic (image
pull/cloud-init) never traverses the tenant network.

Creating the provisioning network (network segment + DHCP + gateway + SNAT) and
performing the initial per-server attach are deployment prerequisites (handled by
the fabric infrastructure / deployment infrastructure), not operator responsibilities. The
provisioning network name configured for the fabric manager must match the one
used at bootstrap.

**Generic `move_network_attachment` role.** The fabric manager exposes a single
generic primitive, keyed on plain network segment **names**:

```
move_network_attachment(host_name, logical_interface_name,
                        from_vnet_name, to_vnet_name)
    → detach the server's fabric port from from_vnet_name (if set),
      then attach it to to_vnet_name (if set)
```

- The role resolves host → fabric server → fabric port, then detaches from the
  source network segment and attaches to the target. Either side may be empty (a
  pure attach or pure detach).
- Detach is a **no-op when the port is not on the named segment** (robust to
  retries and unexpected state); attach fails if the target segment or port
  cannot be resolved.
- It operates purely against the fabric manager — **no Subnet CR lookup inside
  the role**. Callers resolve a `subnetRef` → tenant network segment name and
  pass the provisioning network name from configuration.
- The primitive is backend-/lifecycle-agnostic: callers decide what the segments
  mean (tenant, provisioning, …), so CaaS can reuse it for its own
  provisioning-network flow.

**Single move playbook, direction from the CR.** One AAP job template
(`osac-move-network-attachment`, playbook
`playbook_osac_move_network_attachment.yml`) serves both provision and
deprovision. It derives direction from the CR: a resource carrying
`metadata.deletionTimestamp` is **offboarding** (tenant → provisioning network);
otherwise it is **onboarding** (provisioning network → tenant). The tenant network
segment is resolved from the sole attachment's `subnetRef` (Subnet CR `metadata.name`
== fabric network segment name); the provisioning network name comes from
configuration. The
bare-metal-fulfillment-operator therefore points **both** its networking-provision
and networking-deprovision providers at the same `osac-move-network-attachment`
template — no direction plumbing in the operator.

#### Topology-Agnostic Operator (Transport is Environment Config)

The operator owns **network segment membership + lifecycle orchestration only**,
referenced by segment **name** (config/CR), never by physical transport:

- moves the fabric port between provisioning and tenant network segments,
- patches `spec.image`, reboots via the BMH annotation,
- discovers the tenant lease (`query_dhcp_lease`, MAC match).

The **transport** is environment config, not code:

- image source = `BareMetalHost.spec.image.url` / template param (local mirror or internet via provisioning network),
- callback/PXE/DHCP network = the metal3 `Provisioning` CR (`Managed`/`Unmanaged`/`Disabled` depending on deployment).

The operator must never assume the provisioning network carries the
image/callback (no egress checks, no SNAT logic).

#### Assumptions

- Single fabric NIC per server on the fabric (moves provisioning↔tenant).
- BMC reachability (Ironic↔BMC) is a deployment prerequisite on a tenant-isolated
  mgmt network; not fabric-managed for now.
- The provisioning network (network segment + DHCP + gateway + egress) and the
  initial per-server attach are deployment prerequisites (deployment infrastructure / inventory
  tooling), as today.
- Inventory tooling sets the `osac.openshift.io/interface-macs` annotation for
  the tenant NIC.
- **Self-contained images**: first boot needs no *tenant-side* internet
  (first-boot egress happens on the provisioning network during boot #1). A
  robust "cloud-init done" signal is a long-term item.

#### Tenant Handoff Signaling

The operator uses conditions and phase to signal tenant handoff readiness:

- `NetworkAttachmentsReady` — the tenant port is attached to the tenant network
  segment (set after the move + segment active wait).
- `NetworkHandoffComplete` — the port has been moved and the server has been
  rebooted; the OS is running on the tenant network.
- `IPDiscoveryComplete` — the tenant-network DHCP IP is discovered and valid.
  The orchestration function (`reconcileNetworkProvisionAndDiscovery`)
  explicitly checks this condition after `reconcileIPDiscovery` returns —
  if `IPDiscoveryComplete=False/TemplateFailed`, the phase is set to `Failed`
  and the flow stops. Without this explicit check, the phase could briefly
  reach `Ready` between IP discovery retry cycles.
- `NetworkOffboardComplete` (deletion only) — the host has been powered off
  while still on the tenant network, prior to the port moving back to the
  provisioning network. Tracked by `reconcileNetworkOffboardShutdown`.
- Phase `Ready` — fully provisioned + on the tenant network + IP known.

**Gating rule:** the operator must not surface a tenant IP or report `Ready`
until after move + segment active + reboot + discovery. The provisioning-network
IP is never exposed to the tenant. External access is signaled separately by
the `ExternalIPAttachment` (DNAT) and `NATGateway` (SNAT) CR statuses.

#### IP Discovery

IP discovery is decoupled from switch port configuration. The `move_network_attachment` role is switch-side only — it moves the server's fabric port onto the tenant subnet's network segment during `reconcileNetworking`, after OS provisioning and before the handoff reboot. It does not query DHCP leases or return an IP address.

After `reconcileProvisioning` completes and the host has received a DHCP lease from the fabric's DHCP server, the operator runs `reconcileIPDiscovery`. This phase dispatches `osac.templates.{{ fabric_manager }}.query_dhcp_lease`, passing the sole attachment's subnet reference and the server's selected port MAC address. The role queries the fabric manager's DHCP lease API for the subnet, matches the port MAC to find the corresponding DHCP-assigned IP, and returns it. The operator writes the discovered IP to `status.networkAttachmentStatuses[].ipAddress` on the BaremetalInstance CR.

**MAC resolution — the `osac.openshift.io/interface-macs` contract.** Bare-metal servers are not registered as named fabric servers, so their DHCP leases appear in the fabric manager's IPAM as MAC-only host entries (no server name). To match a lease, the operator must know the selected NIC MAC. Inventory tooling annotates each `BareMetalHost` with a JSON map of OSAC interface name → NIC MAC, e.g. `{"eth9":"52:54:00:16:04:83"}`, under the `osac.openshift.io/interface-macs` annotation. During `reconcileIPDiscovery` the operator reads this annotation, resolves the sole attachment's interface to a MAC, and passes it to the job as an extra var. The `query_dhcp_lease` role matches the IPAM host by MAC (the fabric manager stores lease MACs lowercase; the role compares against the lowercased `mac[].address` values). When no MAC is supplied, the role falls back to matching by server name — the path named CaaS fabric servers use, which BMaaS is converging onto.

The operator writes both the discovered IP and `primary: true` to the status entry for the resolved attachment (the status-side reflection of the implicit-primary rule). The feedback controller syncs this to the fulfillment-service DB via the existing Signal / `syncStatus()` pattern, and the ExternalIPAttachment controller has one deterministic IP to read for DNAT creation.

#### Component Responsibility Summary

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------|
| fulfillment-service | Validate network_attachments, create CR, copy to K8s CR via mutateBMI, auto-provision ExternalIP |
| bare-metal-fulfillment-operator | Inventory assignment, switch-side networking (dispatcher), OS provisioning (AAP), **IP discovery** via `query_dhcp_lease` dispatcher call after provisioning, power management |
| AAP BM provisioning template | OS provisioning only (host-side networking handled by DHCP) |
| osac-operator feedback controller | Signal fulfillment-service on status changes (unchanged), sync IP addresses from CR status to DB |
| osac-operator BMI cleanup controller | Clean up auto-provisioned ExternalIPAttachment → ExternalIP on BaremetalInstance deletion (phased requeue, `baremetalinstance-cleanup` finalizer) |
| osac-operator ExternalIPAttachment controller | Read BM's primary IP from CR status, create DNAT via fabric_manager |
| fabric_manager role (move_network_attachment) | Switch-side only: resolve host → fabric server → fabric port, detach from the source network segment (if set) and attach to the target segment (if set). Waits for target segment active state after attach. Serves both provisioning → tenant (provision) and tenant → provisioning (deprovision) |
| fabric_manager role (query_dhcp_lease) | Query fabric manager's DHCP lease API for a subnet, match the port MAC (or fall back to server name) to find the DHCP-assigned IP, return it |

#### Reconciliation Phase Ordering

**Target reconcile flow (provision-then-handoff):**

```
bare-metal-fulfillment-operator BareMetalInstance controller phases:
1. reconcileInventory → allocate host, populate HostClass
   Sets condition: InventoryAssigned=True

2. reconcileProvisioning → OS provisioning (AAP). Server stays on the provisioning network.
   Host PXE boots and gets IP from DHCP on the provisioning network.
   Requires: InventoryAssigned=True
   Sets condition: ProvisionTemplateComplete=True

3. reconcileNetworking → move fabric port provisioning network → tenant network
   (dispatcher, switch-side only; waits for network segment active after attach)
   Requires: ProvisionTemplateComplete=True
   Sets condition: NetworkAttachmentsReady=True

4. reconcileReboot → reboot server (BMH annotation) so OS re-DHCPs on tenant network
   Requires: NetworkAttachmentsReady=True
   Sets condition: NetworkHandoffComplete=True

5. reconcileIPDiscovery → query fabric manager's DHCP lease API via dispatcher
   (query_dhcp_lease), match port MAC to assigned IP on tenant network, write to CR status
   Requires: NetworkHandoffComplete=True
   Sets condition: IPDiscoveryComplete=True

6. Phase Ready → fully provisioned + on tenant network + IP known
   Requires: IPDiscoveryComplete=True

7. reconcilePower → power state management (independent)

Deletion (power-off-first — tenant workloads never touch provisioning network):
1. reconcileNetworkOffboardShutdown → power off while port is still on tenant network
   Sets condition: NetworkOffboardComplete=True
2. reconcileNetworking (delete) → move port tenant network → provisioning network
   Host is off — nothing runs on provisioning network
3. reconcileDeprovisioning → Ironic PXE boots cleaning ramdisk (not tenant OS)
4. reconcileInventory (delete) → unassign host
```

The server sits on the **provisioning network** (config identifier `netris_bm_provisioning_vnet`, with DHCP + gateway + egress) from bootstrap through the entire metal3 deploy and first boot. First-boot cloud-init runs there **with egress**, so first-boot pulls succeed. Only after `ProvisionTemplateComplete` does the operator move the fabric port to the tenant network (waiting for the network segment to reach active state) and perform the handoff reboots so the OS re-DHCPs on the tenant network (see DHCP lease handoff below).

**DHCP lease handoff — deterministic second reboot.** Moving the fabric port from the provisioning network to the tenant network moves the host's NIC to the tenant V-Net, so the host must obtain a fresh DHCP lease there. This does not complete on the first post-switch reboot; a second reboot is deterministically required before the host holds a tenant-V-Net lease. This is expected, deterministic behavior — not a timing or race condition. The operator performs the second reboot as a standard step of the handoff, after which `reconcileIPDiscovery` reads the tenant-V-Net lease. (Fabric managers that scope DHCP strictly per segment may not require the second reboot.)

### Security Considerations

This feature inherits the existing security model:
- Tenant isolation via `osac.openshift.io/tenant` annotation enforced by OPA policies
- Auto-provisioned resources (ExternalIP, ExternalIPAttachment) inherit tenant annotation from parent BaremetalInstance
- No new authentication or authorization changes
- SecurityGroup rules control BM inbound traffic (tenant-configurable via explicit SG or default SG)
- The single BM network attachment uses the same SecurityGroup enforcement as the rest of the fabric

### Failure Handling and Recovery

#### bare-metal-fulfillment-operator Reconciliation Failures

- Inventory assignment failure (no free hosts): BaremetalInstance enters Failed state with condition, retries when host becomes available
- Networking failure (dispatcher call failed, switch port config failed): BaremetalInstance enters Failed state with condition, retries on manual correction
- AAP job failure (template execution error): BaremetalInstance enters Failed state with AAP job ID in status, manual investigation required

#### Auto ExternalIP Allocation Failures

- Pool exhaustion: create API call returns error, no resources persisted (pool capacity checked synchronously during the API call — see [auto-provisioning lifecycle](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#external-access-same-for-all-resource-types))
- ExternalIP provisioning failure: ExternalIP enters Failed state, BaremetalInstance remains in Pending (external access unavailable, BM may still function without inbound connectivity)
- ExternalIPAttachment provisioning failure: DNAT rule not created, inbound traffic does not reach BM (BM functional, external access unavailable)

#### Cleanup Failures

- Auto-provisioned resource cleanup transient failure: finalizer retries
- Auto-provisioned resource cleanup permanent failure: after N retries, finalizer is removed, parent resource deleted, orphaned ExternalIP/ExternalIPAttachment left in cluster (manual cleanup required)

### RBAC / Tenancy

The bare-metal-fulfillment-operator needs additional RBAC permissions: get/list/watch on Subnet and NetworkClass CRs, required for the dispatcher to resolve networking configuration during `reconcileNetworking`.

All new resources (BaremetalInstance with new fields, auto-provisioned ExternalIP/ExternalIPAttachment) inherit tenant isolation from parent:
- `osac.openshift.io/tenant` annotation propagated from BaremetalInstance to auto-created resources
- OPA policies enforce tenant-scoped operations according to each resource API;
  networking resources use create/list/get/delete and do not expose
  update/patch, while supported non-network workload updates remain available
- Tenant User can view and manage auto-provisioned resources (labeled `osac.openshift.io/auto-created: "true"`) via standard API

### Observability and Monitoring

New structured log events:
- bare-metal-fulfillment-operator: `NetworkingReconciled` (info), `NetworkingReconciliationFailed` (error), `SwitchPortConfigured` (info), `IPAddressAllocated` (info)
- fulfillment-service: `AutoProvisionedExternalIP` (info), `ExternalIPPoolExhausted` (error), `InterfaceValidationFailed` (error)

New Kubernetes events on BaremetalInstance:
- `NetworkingConfigured`: switch ports configured, IPs allocated
- `NetworkingConfigurationFailed`: networking reconciliation failed (dispatcher error, switch port config error)
- `AutoExternalIPCreated`: ExternalIP and ExternalIPAttachment auto-provisioned

No new metrics or alerts (existing provisioning duration and failure rate metrics apply).

### Risks and Mitigations

#### Risk: fabric_manager implementation blocked or delayed

**Impact:** The fabric manager `move_network_attachment` role and a provisioned provisioning network segment are prerequisites for BMaaS networking. Without them, switch port configuration cannot function.

**Mitigation:** Prioritize Netris BM roles (OSAC-2081). Accept that BMaaS remains unavailable until a fabric_manager exists. Document as a hard dependency.

**Reviewed by:** Engineering / Product

#### Risk: ExternalIPPool exhaustion

**Impact:** Auto ExternalIP allocation fails, create API call returns error, tenant cannot create BM with `auto_external_ip_attachment=true`.

**Mitigation:** Pool capacity visible in status; clear error directs tenant to explicit allocation from another pool or contact admin.

**Reviewed by:** Cloud Provider Admin

#### Risk: Two-operator architecture synchronization

**Impact:** bare-metal-fulfillment-operator and osac-operator feedback controller both watch BaremetalInstance CR. Reconciliation phases must be carefully ordered to avoid race conditions.

**Mitigation:** Reconciliation phase ordering enforced via status conditions: inventory → provisioning → networking → reboot → IP discovery. Integration tests covering full lifecycle. Document finalizer dependencies.

**Reviewed by:** osac-operator / bare-metal-fulfillment-operator teams

### Drawbacks

#### Two-operator architecture complexity

bare-metal-fulfillment-operator handles provisioning and networking, osac-operator feedback controller only watches status changes. This split adds synchronization complexity compared to a single-operator model.

**Trade-off:** Separation of concerns (provisioning vs. feedback) vs. operational simplicity. Chosen approach: maintain two-operator architecture to avoid merging codebases. Document reconciliation phase ordering and finalizer dependencies.

## Alternatives (Not Implemented)

### Alternative 1: Single-operator architecture

Merge bare-metal-fulfillment-operator into osac-operator to simplify reconciliation and eliminate feedback controller.

**Rejected because:** bare-metal-fulfillment-operator is a separate codebase with its own Ironic/Metal3 integration. Merging would require significant refactoring and change ownership model. Current two-operator architecture is stable and proven.

### Alternative 2: Operator IPAM (pre-allocate IPs)

Operator pre-allocates IPs from subnet CIDR during reconcileNetworking and writes static config (IP, gateway, prefix, DNS) to CR status. Template applies static config to host.

**Rejected because:** DHCP is simpler, OS-agnostic, and already provided by the fabric infrastructure. Static config requires per-OS template logic (cloud-init, NMState, kickstart) and adds IPAM complexity (allocation tracking, cross-operator concurrency, gateway/DNS discovery). DHCP handles all of this automatically.

## Open Questions

### ~~1. Should auto NATGateway treat a Deleting NATGateway as 'does not exist'?~~ — Resolved

Resolved: NATGateway reuse limited to Ready only. Failed/Deleting NATGateways cause the create request to fail with an error. NATGateway auto-provisioning per resource was removed — NATGateway is now a VN default created at tenant onboarding.

### ~~2. Should capacity exhaustion return an API error or create a Failed resource?~~ — Resolved

Resolved: Return error, no resource persisted. Pool capacity checked synchronously. No Failed resource.

### ~~3. IP address assignment~~ — Resolved

Resolved: DHCP handles IP assignment. The host receives its IP from the fabric's DHCP server after booting on the network segment. No operator IPAM needed.

### ~~4. How is the host's runtime IP discovered after network reconfiguration?~~ — Resolved

Resolved: After `reconcileProvisioning` completes and the host has received a DHCP lease, the operator queries the fabric manager's DHCP lease API via dispatcher (`query_dhcp_lease` role). The role matches the server's port MAC address — resolved from the BareMetalHost `osac.openshift.io/interface-macs` annotation — to find the assigned IP (falling back to server-name matching for named fabric servers). The operator writes to `status.networkAttachmentStatuses[].ipAddress` on the BaremetalInstance CR. The feedback controller then syncs to fulfillment-service via Signal RPC. `move_network_attachment` remains switch-side only (moves the fabric port between network segments).

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests

- fulfillment-service: max-one attachment and primary validation (accept single implicit primary, accept explicit primary)
- fulfillment-service: omitted and partial attachment defaulting (empty `security_groups` is missing; supplied values are preserved; a missing group list defaults only for the tenant default VirtualNetwork and is rejected for a non-default subnet without caller-supplied groups)
- fulfillment-service: interface validation (reject an interface not in BareMetalInstanceType)
- fulfillment-service: auto ExternalIP pool selection (pick READY pool with most capacity, respect IP family)
- bare-metal-fulfillment-operator: reconcileNetworking phase ordering (after provisioning, before reboot; inventory → provisioning → networking → reboot → IP discovery)
- bare-metal-fulfillment-operator: dispatcher call for the sole attachment (move_network_attachment with correct from/to network segment params, direction from deletionTimestamp)
- bare-metal-fulfillment-operator: `buildSubnetMACMap` resolves subnetRef → MAC from the interface-macs annotation (single-NIC fallback when interface unset)

### Integration Tests

- E2E: create BaremetalInstance with two attachments, verify the API rejects the request
- E2E: create BaremetalInstance with `--external-ip-attachment`, verify auto ExternalIP + ExternalIPAttachment created, DNAT rule functional
- E2E: delete BaremetalInstance with auto-provisioned resources, verify ExternalIPAttachment and ExternalIP cleaned up
- E2E: create BaremetalInstance with interface not in BareMetalInstanceType, verify error returned
- E2E: create BaremetalInstance with a second `--network-attachment`, verify the CLI and API return a maximum-one error
- E2E: verify IP discovery (`query_dhcp_lease` role queries fabric manager DHCP lease API after provisioning + reboot, matches port MAC to assigned IP on tenant network, operator writes to CR status, feedback controller syncs to fulfillment-service, ExternalIPAttachment controller reads primary IP)
- E2E: verify the port move and reboot flow — create BMI provisions on the provisioning network, then moves the fabric port provisioning network → tenant network + reboots; delete BMI returns it tenant → provisioning network (confirm in fabric manager; a freed server can re-inspect with internet)
- E2E: verify isolation-until-ready — before the move, a tenant vantage cannot reach the server; after move + reboot, it can, and the server is no longer on the provisioning network

### Tricky Test Cases

- BM with one attachment and omitted `primary` (verify the sole attachment is normalized to `primary: true` in the CR/status and is the default route)
- ExternalIPPool exhaustion (verify error returned, no resource created)
- Auto-provisioned resource cleanup failure (verify finalizer retry, eventual orphan cleanup)
- IP address feedback latency (verify ExternalIPAttachment controller waits for IP to appear in status)

## Long-Term Evolution (The Reboot is the Seam)

The structure `inventory → provision → establish-tenant-networking → discovery`
stays; only "establish-tenant-networking" changes:

**Ironic Standalone Networking** (metal3-docs PR #586; BMO PR #3469, ToR
networking part 1): Ironic switches the port VLAN per lifecycle phase
(provisioning→tenant) on one NIC — drop the reboot. Upstream assumes
`networking-generic-switch` (direct ToR control), which does not fit
The fabric manager owns the switch; adopting a new backend means implementing the fabric manager interface or aligning the model.

**Dedicated always-on provisioning NIC** (two NICs): attach the tenant NIC after
`provisioned`; no move of the provisioning NIC. Needs 2 NICs, a local registry,
gateway-less provisioning DHCP, and provisioning-network isolation.

**Static host-side networking + IPAM** (`networkData`): one boot, but not
OS-agnostic and reintroduces IPAM. Opt-in fast path for capable, self-contained
images.

Each evolution replaces just the reboot step while preserving the same overall
flow and operator structure.

## Graduation Criteria

## Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

### Upgrade

Micro version upgrades (`x.y.N → x.y.N+2`):
- New fields (`network_attachments`, `auto_external_ip_attachment`) are additive — existing BaremetalInstance resources continue to work without networking fields
- No user action required

Minor version upgrades (`x.N → x.N+1`):
- Tenant User encouraged to migrate to new networking fields by upgrading the
  CLI (`osac-cli` supports the new `--network-attachment` flag with `--interface`
  and `--primary`)
- No breaking changes — networking fields remain optional

### Downgrade

If `N+1` upgrade fails or cluster is misbehaving:
- Manual rollback: update fulfillment-service and bare-metal-fulfillment-operator images to `N`
- Existing BaremetalInstance resources with new `network_attachments` field will be unrecognized by `N` operator
- Manual cleanup required: delete BaremetalInstance resources created with new field, re-create without networking fields
- Auto-provisioned ExternalIP resources remain (manual cleanup required if not needed)

Acceptable downgrade steps:
- Delete CRs using new field (`network_attachments`)
- Re-create without networking fields
- Manually delete orphaned auto-provisioned resources (ExternalIP, ExternalIPAttachment labeled `osac.openshift.io/auto-created: "true"`)

## Version Skew Strategy

### Control Plane Skew

fulfillment-service, osac-operator, and bare-metal-fulfillment-operator are deployed together in the same namespace and upgraded atomically (all controlled by osac-installer). No skew expected.

### Client Skew

osac-cli (n-1) with fulfillment-service (n):
- Old CLI does not support `--network-attachment` flag → creates BM without networking fields (default behavior)
- New CLI uses new `--network-attachment` flag → server accepts new field

osac-cli (n) with fulfillment-service (n-1):
- New CLI uses new `--network-attachment` flag → old server rejects unknown field
- Workaround: omit `--network-attachment` flag until server is upgraded

Recommendation: keep osac-cli and fulfillment-service within one minor version.

## Support Procedures

### Symptom: BaremetalInstance stuck in Pending, condition "NetworkingConfigurationFailed"

**Detection:**
```bash
kubectl describe baremetalinstance <name> -n <namespace>
# Check status.conditions for NetworkingConfigurationFailed
```

**Cause:** Dispatcher call failed or switch port config failed

**Resolution:**
1. Check bare-metal-fulfillment-operator logs for networking phase errors (dispatcher)
2. Check AAP job logs for `move_network_attachment` role errors (switch-side) — e.g. port not found on the server, or the provisioning/tenant network segment not resolvable
3. If fabric manager unreachable, investigate connectivity
4. If switch port config failed, investigate switch configuration

### Symptom: BM has no default gateway

**Detection:** BM cannot reach external networks, `ip route` shows no default route

**Cause:** The resolved sole attachment/interface is missing or not Ready. Omission of `primary` is valid and means the sole attachment is implicitly primary.

**Resolution:**
1. Check BaremetalInstance spec: `kubectl get baremetalinstance <name> -n <namespace> -o yaml`
2. Verify there is exactly one `networkAttachments[]` entry
3. Inspect the resolved attachment and interface status, then correct the attachment or underlying network resource and recreate the BaremetalInstance if necessary

### Symptom: Auto-provisioned ExternalIP not cleaned up after BaremetalInstance deletion

**Detection:** `kubectl get externalip` shows orphaned ExternalIP labeled `osac.openshift.io/auto-created: "true"` with no parent

**Cause:** Finalizer cleanup failed permanently

**Resolution:**
1. Check BaremetalInstance deletion logs (bare-metal-fulfillment-operator logs) for cleanup errors
2. Manually delete orphaned ExternalIPAttachment: `kubectl delete externalipattachment <name> -n <namespace>`
3. Manually delete orphaned ExternalIP: `kubectl delete externalip <name> -n <namespace>`

### Symptom: ExternalIPAttachment stuck in Pending, waiting for BM IP address

**Detection:** `kubectl describe externalipattachment <name> -n <namespace>` shows condition "WaitingForIPAddress"

**Cause:** Host has not yet received DHCP-assigned IP (provisioning still in progress or failed)

**Resolution:**
1. Check BaremetalInstance status: `kubectl get baremetalinstance <name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.status.networkAttachmentStatuses[?(@.primary==true)].ipAddress}'`
2. If IP is missing, check bare-metal-fulfillment-operator logs for provisioning phase completion
3. If provisioning completed but IP missing, investigate `query_dhcp_lease` dispatcher call (DHCP lease query may have failed, returned empty, or port MAC did not match any lease). Confirm the BareMetalHost carries the `osac.openshift.io/interface-macs` annotation with the attachment's interface — without it, MAC matching is skipped and only named fabric servers resolve

### Disabling the feature

To disable auto ExternalIP attachment:
- Remove or redact ExternalIPPool CRs (capacity exhaustion prevents auto allocation)
- No API extension to disable (fields are part of CRD, cannot be removed at runtime)

Consequences:
- Auto ExternalIP allocation fails with error (resource not created)
- Manual ExternalIP workflows remain functional
- No impact on existing running BM servers

## Infrastructure Needed

- AAP execution environment with the fabric manager `move_network_attachment` role
- A provisioned provisioning network segment (DHCP + gateway + SNAT, config identifier `netris_bm_provisioning_vnet`) and the initial per-server attach, plus the BareMetalHost `osac.openshift.io/interface-macs` annotation — deployment prerequisites (deployment infrastructure)
- Dispatcher core (OSAC-1457, OSAC-1458, OSAC-1460)
- Integration test environment with fabric manager and Ironic/Metal3 backend
