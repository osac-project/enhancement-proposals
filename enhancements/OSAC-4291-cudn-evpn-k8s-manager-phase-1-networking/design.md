# CUDN EVPN K8s Manager Phase 1 Networking: Single-Cluster VM-to-Fabric Bridging

## Summary

This design extends OSAC-1433's NetworkClass two-manager architecture with a new k8s manager (`cudn_evpn`) that provisions OVN-Kubernetes ClusterUserDefinedNetwork (CUDN) with EVPN transport, enabling KubeVirt VMs to join the physical fabric via BGP EVPN route advertisement. The design covers sequential provisioning (fabric → k8s manager data flow), CUDN lifecycle, VM placement and second-Subnet validation, and integration test patterns. A VirtualNetwork supports VM placement only while it has one Subnet: adding another is rejected while VMs exist, and a multi-Subnet VirtualNetwork is fabric-only with VM placement rejected. FRRConfiguration for BGP underlay peering is an installation prerequisite (not created by k8s manager); OVN-Kubernetes auto-updates it when CUDN appears. See [PRD](prd.md) for detailed requirements.

This manager inherits the [Unified Networking deployment support
boundary](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#deployment-support-boundary):
Phase 1 supports connected deployments only and does not add air-gapped or
disconnected networking support.
This manager also inherits the [Unified Networking hub support
boundary](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#networking-hub-support-boundary):
OSAC networking supports exactly one provider-owned hub per deployment.
Multi-hub networking placement, cross-hub resource coordination, and
cross-hub network connectivity are unsupported. This boundary applies only to
the networking area and does not define hub behavior for other OSAC areas.
Multiple hosting/workload clusters remain supported where a networking feature
explicitly specifies them.

## Related Designs

This design builds on and interacts with several networking designs:

- **OSAC-1435 VMaaS Networking** — VMs provisioned via `ComputeNetworkAttachment` consume the cudn_evpn namespaces created by this design. VMaaS placement logic must resolve the namespace name (same as Subnet name) when placing VMs in EVPN-bridged Subnets. VMaaS must validate that the target Subnet has a CUDN and that its VirtualNetwork has exactly one Subnet before allowing VM placement.
- **OSAC-1436 CaaS Networking** — CaaS clusters may run on EVPN-bridged subnets. Port-move primitive compatibility with EVPN transport (VXLAN encap vs VLAN trunking) is TBD (out of scope for Phase 1).
- **OSAC-1437 BMaaS Networking** — Bare-metal servers provisioned via `BareMetalNetworkAttachment` are L2 peers of EVPN-bridged VMs when attached to the same Subnet. Any cross-Subnet L3 test uses fabric and bare-metal endpoints in a separate multi-Subnet VirtualNetwork with no VMs.
- **OSAC-1433 Default Networking** — Auto-provisioning of VirtualNetwork, Subnet, NetworkACL, and NATGateway at tenant onboarding uses a default NetworkClass. `cudn_evpn` is **not suitable** as the default NetworkClass due to manual prerequisites (VTEP, FRR, BGP underlay). Default networking should use a simpler k8s manager (e.g., k8s-only or none).
- **OSAC-2135 CaaS BM Worker Provisioning** — System-tenant bare-metal instances reference tenant Subnets. If those Subnets use `cudn_evpn`, the BMI provisioning flow interacts with the EVPN namespace/CUDN. Interaction is TBD (out of scope for Phase 1).
- **OSAC-1382 Multi-Fabric East-West** — Phase 1 east-west isolation domains will need to work across EVPN-bridged and non-EVPN subnets. Inter-domain routing with EVPN transport is TBD (out of scope for Phase 1).

## Motivation

OSAC runs VMs on OpenShift using KubeVirt. VM IP addresses exist only within the OVN overlay network and are not visible on the physical fabric. This prevents VMs from sharing L2 Subnets with bare-metal servers and keeps them outside the physical fabric routing domain. Phase 1 validates VM-to-fabric reachability on the same Subnet at L2.

The CUDN LocalNet approach (OSAC-1511) was frozen in favor of OVN EVPN, which provides better scalability and multi-cluster support (validated by OSAC-1717 spike). This design delivers single-cluster EVPN bridging as Phase 1, with a constraint that OVN-Kubernetes cannot currently route between separate CUDNs on the same cluster (Connectors feature pending).

**Implementation Context:**
OSAC's NetworkClass dispatcher already supports dual-manager provisioning (fabric + k8s). This design adds the second k8s manager type (`cudn_evpn` alongside existing `k8s-only`) and solves the fabric-to-k8s data dependency: fabric manager allocates VNI, k8s manager consumes it to configure CUDN. The current multi-target provisioning evaluates targets sequentially within each reconcile cycle (both can be in-flight simultaneously on AAP); this design adds a gate to ensure the fabric target completes and produces output before the k8s target is evaluated.

### Goals

- Reuse NetworkClass dispatcher pattern and two-manager architecture from OSAC-1433
- Sequential provisioning pattern reusable for future fabric-to-k8s dependencies
- **Single-subnet-for-VMs constraint:**
  - Only single-subnet VirtualNetworks support VMs (CUDN provisioning)
  - First Subnet gets CUDN immediately (on Subnet provisioning, not VM creation)
  - CUDN persists when adding subnets, but VMs blocked in all subnets
  - API validation: Block second subnet creation if first has VMs (preserves VM topology)
  - VMaaS validation: Block VM creation if subnet count > 1 (enforces single-subnet constraint)
- K8s manager playbook creates CUDN as Kubernetes-native resource (no external API calls)
- FRRConfiguration for BGP underlay peering is installation prerequisite (auto-updated by OVN-Kubernetes, not by k8s manager)
- Installation prerequisites documented for Cloud Infrastructure Admin

### Non-Goals

- Multi-cluster VM placement (deferred to OSAC-3667 Phase 2)
- Inter-subnet L3 routing between VMs on same cluster (requires OVN Connectors)
- Multiple subnets per VirtualNetwork with multi-NIC VMs (deferred to Phase 2 when OVN-K supports secondary CUDNs — will enable VMs with multiple NICs, one per subnet)
- IPv6 or dual-stack support (Phase 1 is IPv4-only)
- Automatic gateway MAC coordination (manual prerequisite)
- Automatic VTEP provisioning (manual prerequisite)

## Proposal

**Central Design Statement:**

Phase 1 extends an existing fabric routing domain and its Subnets into OpenShift. **VMs require a single Subnet with a READY CUDN and namespace.** The first eligible Subnet gets a CUDN immediately (on provisioning, not VM creation). A single fabric-only Subnet is not VM-eligible, and deleting the CUDN-backed Subnet does not promote a remaining fabric-only Subnet. To restore VM support, create a new VirtualNetwork with a first Subnet that receives a READY CUDN. The Subnet's explicit NetworkACL association remains an independent, VirtualNetwork-scoped resource that may be reused by other Subnets. The configured fabric manager owns provisioning and enforcement of that ACL. `NetworkACL.status.phase == "Ready"` is the authoritative signal that its rules are active; `Subnet.status.conditions[type=NetworkACLAssociationReady] == True` is the authoritative signal that this policy is enforced on that specific Subnet. A first CUDN-backed Subnet is not READY until both ACL signals, fabric provisioning, the CUDN, and its namespace are Ready. A fabric-only Subnet is not READY until fabric provisioning and both ACL signals are complete. A completed fabric job or VNI ConfigMap does not prove ACL enforcement. The policy is not attached to the VM or CUDN, and the CUDN/K8s manager does not implement ACL behavior. If additional Subnets are added, the CUDN persists but VMaaS blocks VMs in all Subnets. Multi-subnet VirtualNetworks are fabric-only until secondary CUDN/multi-NIC support is available.

This design introduces a new k8s manager (`cudn_evpn`) registered via osac-installer ConfigMap, used when a NetworkClass declares `k8s_manager: "cudn_evpn"`.

**Resource Mapping:**

| OSAC Resource | fabric manager Resource | OVN-K Resource | VM Support |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| VirtualNetwork | fabric manager VPC (L3 ipVRF) | — | — |
| Subnet's NetworkACL association | Independent ACL scoped to the parent VirtualNetwork; `NetworkACL.status.phase == "Ready"` and the Subnet's `NetworkACLAssociationReady=True` condition report active enforcement | — | Required before the Subnet is READY |
| First Subnet (alone, CUDN and namespace READY) | fabric manager VNet (L2 macVRF) | CUDN (primary) | ✅ VMs allowed |
| First Subnet (with second+) | fabric manager VNet (L2 macVRF) | CUDN (persists) | ❌ VMs blocked |
| Second+ Subnets | fabric manager VNet (L2 macVRF) | — | ❌ Fabric-only |

- **One CUDN per VirtualNetwork** (Phase 1 limitation - OVN-K lacks secondary CUDN support)
- **Multiple VNets per VPC** (supported by the configured fabric manager; all share the same IP-VRF)
- **First Subnet CUDN created immediately** (on Subnet provisioning, not VM creation)
- **CUDN persists when adding subnets** (but VMaaS blocks VMs in all subnets if multiple exist)

**Provisioning Trigger:** CUDN is created at **first Subnet** provisioning time (not VirtualNetwork creation).

**Subnet provisioning sequence:**

1. **Physical fabric manager** runs when Subnet is created:
   - Creates or gets fabric manager VPC for parent VirtualNetwork (idempotent, allocates L3 VNI if new)
   - Creates the fabric segment for this Subnet (allocates L2 VNI)
   - Applies the independent NetworkACL referenced by the Subnet and reports when the policy is active on that Subnet; one ACL may be reused by multiple Subnets in the VirtualNetwork
   - Extracts VNI and reserved IP ranges
   - Writes output to ConfigMap: `{l2_vni, l3_vni, fabric_reserved_range}`
2. **Subnet controller** waits for segment provisioning, `NetworkACL.status.phase == "Ready"`, and the Subnet's `NetworkACLAssociationReady=True` condition; it passes VNI data from ConfigMap through the existing CUDN provisioning flow but does not report the first Subnet READY yet
3. **K8s manager** (cudn_evpn) provisions CUDN (first Subnet only):
   - `spec.network.evpn.macVRF.vni = l2_vni` (from fabric manager VNet)
   - `spec.network.evpn.ipVRF.vni = l3_vni` (from fabric manager VPC)
   - `spec.network.layer2.reservedSubnets = [fabric_reserved_range]` (prevents OVN IPAM collision with fabric gateway/DHCP)
   - Route targets auto-generated by CUDN as "AS:VNI" (Phase 1 - explicit RT control deferred to Phase 2)
   - Gateway IP owned by fabric manager SVI (CUDN has no logical router port - fabric routes L3)
   - OVN-Kubernetes auto-updates FRRConfiguration when CUDN appears
   - Waits for both the CUDN and namespace to become Ready before completing; the Subnet controller reports the first Subnet READY only after fabric, ACL, CUDN, and namespace readiness are all confirmed. Fabric-only Subnets do not wait for CUDN.

**ACL activation and Subnet readiness:** The NetworkACL controller sets
`NetworkACL.status.phase` to `Ready` only after the configured manager confirms
that the current rules are active. For a Subnet association, the manager's
activation result is reflected by
`Subnet.status.conditions[type=NetworkACLAssociationReady] = True`. The
Subnet controller requires both `NetworkACL.status.phase == "Ready"` and that
Subnet condition before setting `Subnet.status.phase` to `Ready`. Fabric job
success and VNI data in the output ConfigMap prove segment/VNI provisioning
only; neither is evidence that the ACL policy is active.

**Important:**
- VirtualNetwork creation does NOT trigger fabric manager VPC or CUDN provisioning
- First Subnet triggers VPC + VNet + CUDN (CUDN created immediately, not on VM creation)
- Second+ Subnets trigger only VNet (fabric-only, no CUDN)
- **CUDN persists when adding subnets**, but VMaaS blocks VMs in all subnets when multiple exist

Key resources:
- **VirtualNetwork** (fulfillment-service): API object only, no fabric provisioning until Subnet created
- **NetworkClass** (fulfillment-service): extended with `k8s_manager` field (already exists)
- **Subnet** (fulfillment-service + osac-operator CRD): triggers fabric (VPC + VNet) and k8s (CUDN) provisioning
- **ClusterUserDefinedNetwork** (OVN-Kubernetes CRD): k8s manager creates with EVPN transport, macVRF/ipVRF VNI (route targets auto-generated in Phase 1, may be explicit in Phase 2)
- **FRRConfiguration** (FRR operator CRD): installation prerequisite (not created by k8s manager), auto-updated by OVN-Kubernetes when CUDN appears

### Workflow Description

**Actor:** Cloud Infrastructure Admin (prerequisite setup) and Tenant Admin (runtime usage)

**Starting State:**
- OCP cluster installed with OVN-Kubernetes, FRR operator, NMState operator
- VTEP CR exists (defines VTEP IPs for each worker node)
- BGP underlay configured (workers peer with fabric switches)
- NetworkClass exists with `fabric_manager: "primary"`, `k8s_manager: "cudn_evpn"`

**Runtime Flow:**

```

**Error Paths:**

- **Second Subnet creation during a placement or with VMs present:** API returns 400 Bad Request. An active or in-progress VM placement or existing VM prevents adding Subnets (Phase 1 limitation). Tenant must let placements finish and delete VMs before adding Subnets, or create a new VirtualNetwork for bare-metal workloads.
- **VM creation when multiple subnets exist:** VMaaS blocks VM placement with error. Only single-subnet VirtualNetworks support VMs. Multiple subnets → VMs blocked in ALL subnets (first subnet's CUDN persists but VM creation blocked by validation). Tenant must delete extra subnets or create new VirtualNetwork for VMs.
- **Subnet creation without a READY same-VirtualNetwork NetworkACL:** API rejects the missing, non-READY, or mismatched association. A Subnet remains non-READY until the configured fabric manager reports the associated policy active.
- **Subnet deletion with active or in-progress VM placements:** The Delete API persists a `Requested` reservation under the VirtualNetwork lock before accepting deletion, blocking new Subnet creates and VM placements. The controller emits a `DeletionBlocked` event and requeues even if no Kubernetes VM object exists yet. It starts deprovisioning only after no placement admission or VM remains and the reservation is `Admitted`.
- **Fabric job failure:** Controller requeues, does not start k8s job until fabric succeeds
- **VNI missing in fabric output:** Controller marks Subnet as Failed, user must check fabric manager logs
- **CUDN creation failure:** K8s job fails, controller requeues, Subnet status shows Failed with AAP job reference

### API Extensions

**New:**
- osac-installer ConfigMap `k8s-manager-cudn-evpn` (declares k8s manager capabilities)
- osac-aap fabric manager template role `fabric_manager` (creates fabric manager VPC/VNet, returns VNI)
- osac-aap k8s manager template role `cudn_evpn` (creates CUDN)
- **Subnet annotation `osac.openshift.io/skip-k8s-manager: "true"`** — optional annotation to explicitly skip k8s manager (fabric-only). If omitted, operator auto-detects: first subnet gets CUDN, second+ subnets are fabric-only.

**Modified:**
- osac-operator Subnet controller: sequential provisioning instead of parallel, auto-detects subnet count to skip k8s manager for second+ subnets under same VirtualNetwork (first subnet's CUDN persists, honors explicit skip annotation if present)

**External CRDs Used (not created by OSAC):**
- `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` (k8s.ovn.org/v1, OVN-Kubernetes) — created by k8s manager
- `FRRConfiguration` (frrk8s.metallb.io/v1beta1, FRR operator) — installation prerequisite, auto-updated by OVN-Kubernetes when CUDN appears
- `VTEP` (k8s.ovn.org/v1, OVN-Kubernetes) — prerequisite, not created by k8s manager

**No changes** to existing fulfillment-service proto schema. NetworkClass.k8s_manager field already exists.

**Annotation Semantics:**

The `osac.openshift.io/skip-k8s-manager` annotation is **optional** and provides explicit control over k8s manager provisioning. When omitted, the operator automatically determines provisioning behavior based on subnet count.

```yaml
# A READY NetworkACL named shared-acl is scoped to vpc-1. It may be reused
# by Subnets in this VirtualNetwork; each Subnet explicitly references it.

# First Subnet - creates fabric manager VNet + CUDN (auto-detected, VMs allowed)
apiVersion: osac.openshift.io/v1
kind: Subnet
metadata:
  name: vm-subnet
spec:
  virtualNetwork: vpc-1  # NetworkClass has k8s_manager: cudn_evpn
  networkACL: shared-acl
  ipv4CIDR: 10.0.1.0/24

---
# Adding second Subnet - first Subnet's CUDN persists, but no CUDN for second
# Phase 1 limitation: VMs blocked in ALL subnets when multiple subnets exist
apiVersion: osac.openshift.io/v1
kind: Subnet
metadata:
  name: baremetal-subnet
spec:
  virtualNetwork: vpc-1  # Same VPC
  networkACL: shared-acl  # Same READY ACL; association is explicit
  ipv4CIDR: 10.0.2.0/24
# Result: vm-subnet's CUDN persists, baremetal-subnet gets fabric-only (no CUDN)
# VMaaS blocks VM creation in BOTH subnets (subnet count > 1)
```

**Provisioning behavior:**
- **First subnet (alone):** Operator provisions fabric + k8s manager (CUDN); VMs are allowed after the CUDN and namespace are READY
- **Second+ subnets:** Operator provisions fabric-only (no CUDN), first subnet's CUDN persists
- **Multiple subnets (2+):** VMs blocked in ALL subnets by VMaaS validation (subnet count > 1)
- **Explicit annotation:** skip k8s manager even if this is the only Subnet (fabric-only by choice)
- Dispatcher only provisions fabric manager target for fabric-only subnets
- fabric manager role creates VNet under same VPC (VPC created by first Subnet, or new if none exists)
- No CUDN, no namespace, no k8s resources are created for second+ Subnets

**Important:** If VMs exist in the single-Subnet VirtualNetwork, API blocks creation of a second Subnet. If a second Subnet is added while no VMs exist, the VirtualNetwork becomes fabric-only and VM placement is blocked in all its Subnets (see validation below).

**Deletion behavior:**
- Subnet controller checks: did this Subnet provision a CUDN? (checks if namespace exists, namespace name = subnet name)
- **First Subnet (has CUDN):** k8s deprovision (CUDN + namespace) → fabric deprovision (fabric manager VNet)
- **Second+ Subnets (no CUDN):** skip k8s deprovision → fabric deprovision only (fabric manager VNet)
- Deleting the CUDN-backed Subnet does not promote a surviving fabric-only Subnet; VM placement remains blocked without a READY CUDN namespace
- VirtualNetwork deletion waits for ALL child Subnets deleted before deleting fabric manager VPC

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

#### fulfillment-service: Subnet Validation

**API-Level VM Constraint**

When a NetworkClass has `k8s_manager: "cudn_evpn"`, fulfillment-service enforces a constraint: **if the first Subnet under a VirtualNetwork has VMs running, block creation of additional Subnets**.

```go
// internal/servers/subnet_server.go
func (s *SubnetServer) Create(ctx context.Context, req *v1.CreateSubnetRequest) (*v1.CreateSubnetResponse, error) {
    // ... existing validation ...

    // Fetch parent VirtualNetwork to get NetworkClass
    vnetResp, err := s.virtualNetworkServer.Get(ctx, &v1.GetVirtualNetworkRequest{
        Id: req.GetSubnet().GetSpec().GetVirtualNetwork(),
    })
    if err != nil {
        return nil, status.Errorf(codes.Internal, "failed to fetch parent VirtualNetwork: %v", err)
    }

    // Fetch NetworkClass to check k8s_manager
    ncResp, err := s.networkClassServer.Get(ctx, &v1.GetNetworkClassRequest{
        Id: vnetResp.GetVirtualNetwork().GetSpec().GetNetworkClass(),
    })
    if err != nil {
        return nil, status.Errorf(codes.Internal, "failed to fetch NetworkClass: %v", err)
    }

    // Enforce single-subnet-with-VMs constraint for cudn_evpn
    k8sManager := ncResp.GetNetworkClass().GetKubernetesManager()
    if k8sManager == "cudn_evpn" {
        // List existing Subnets under this VirtualNetwork
        // Acquire the shared VirtualNetwork-scoped admission lock before reading topology.
        // Hold it through committing this Subnet so VM placement cannot race the check.
        // Reject while any Subnet deletion reservation is Requested or Admitted for this VirtualNetwork.
        listResp, err := s.List(ctx, &v1.ListSubnetsRequest{
            Filter: fmt.Sprintf("spec.virtualNetwork='%s'", vnetResp.GetVirtualNetwork().GetId()),
        })
        if err != nil {
            return nil, status.Errorf(codes.Internal, "failed to list existing subnets: %v", err)
        }

        // Check authoritative VM placement admissions, including pending placements.
        if len(listResp.GetSubnets()) > 0 {
            hasVMs, err := s.checkVirtualNetworkHasVMs(ctx, vnetResp.GetVirtualNetwork().GetId())
            if err != nil {
                return nil, status.Errorf(codes.Internal, "failed to check VM placements in VirtualNetwork: %v", err)
            }

            if hasVMs {
                return nil, status.Errorf(codes.FailedPrecondition,
                    "Cannot create additional subnets under VirtualNetwork %q: "+
                    "active or in-progress VM placements exist. "+
                    "Phase 1 limitation: cudn_evpn supports only one subnet per VirtualNetwork when VMs are present. "+
                    "To add subnets for bare-metal workloads, delete VMs first or create a new VirtualNetwork.",
                    vnetResp.GetVirtualNetwork().GetMetadata().GetName())
            }

            // No active or in-progress VM placements → allow second subnet (fabric-only).
        }
    }

    // ... continue with normal create flow ...
}

func (s *SubnetServer) checkVirtualNetworkHasVMs(ctx context.Context, virtualNetworkID string) (bool, error) {
    // Query active ComputeInstance placement admissions for this VirtualNetwork,
    // including pending/provisioning placements. Keep an admission active until
    // the VM is fully removed; do not rely only on the eventually-consistent K8s VM list.
    // VM placement acquires the same lock and rejects a target VirtualNetwork
    // with a deleting Subnet or an active Subnet deletion admission.
}
```

**Rationale:**
- **Single subnet (no VMs):** Allow second subnet creation → second subnet is fabric-only (bare-metal)
- **Single subnet (with VMs):** Block second subnet creation → Phase 1 limitation, VMs lock subnet topology
- Fail-fast at API level prevents confusion (clear error before provisioning starts)
- Once VMs exist, topology is locked (cannot add fabric-only subnets for bare-metal)
- Tenant must choose: VMs-only VirtualNetwork OR delete VMs to add bare-metal subnets OR create new VirtualNetwork

#### Atomic VirtualNetwork Admission

Subnet creation, Subnet deletion, and VM placement use one distributed admission lock keyed by VirtualNetwork ID. Each path acquires the lock before reading current Subnet and VM-placement state and holds it through persisting the admitted create, placement, or deletion request. The Subnet Delete API acquires the lock and persists a VirtualNetwork-scoped `Requested` reservation before accepting the deletion; the controller creates the same reservation idempotently if it observes a delete initiated through another path. VM placement records its admission before releasing the lock; Subnet creation checks active and in-progress placements, not only Kubernetes VM objects. The `Requested` reservation blocks new Subnet creates and VM placements while existing placements drain. The controller checks active and in-progress placement admissions and VM objects on each reconcile; only when none remain does it transition the reservation to `Admitted` and start cleanup. Both reservation states remain active until fabric and K8s cleanup succeeds and the Subnet finalizer is removed. The distributed lease is not held across asynchronous deprovisioning. All service replicas honor the shared lock and reservation, and an operation fails or retries if it cannot acquire the lock or recheck state while holding it. This prevents stale admissions and deletion-versus-placement races.

#### VMaaS: VM Placement Validation

**Summary:**
- ✅ **Single subnet** under VirtualNetwork → **VMs allowed**
- ❌ **Multiple subnets** under VirtualNetwork → **VMs blocked in ALL subnets** by VMaaS validation
- CUDN persists (not deleted) when second subnet added, but VMs blocked by subnet count validation

**VM Creation Validation Logic:**

VMaaS enforces subnet count validation before allowing VM placement in EVPN-bridged subnets. Only single-subnet VirtualNetworks support VMs.

```go
// VMaaS ComputeInstance controller (pseudo-code)
func (r *ComputeInstanceReconciler) validateSubnetForVM(ctx context.Context, subnet *osacv1.Subnet) error {
    // Caller holds the shared VirtualNetwork-scoped admission lock until the
    // ComputeInstance placement has been persisted.
    // Check if subnet has cudn_evpn k8s manager
    networkClass := getNetworkClass(ctx, subnet)
    if networkClass.Spec.KubernetesManager != "cudn_evpn" {
        // Not EVPN-bridged, use regular placement logic
        return nil
    }

    // Reject placement while a Subnet deletion is pending or admitted for this VirtualNetwork.
    if hasDeletingSubnetOrAdmission(ctx, subnet.Spec.VirtualNetwork) {
        return fmt.Errorf("Cannot create VM while a Subnet is being deleted in VirtualNetwork %q", subnet.Spec.VirtualNetwork)
    }

    // For cudn_evpn: count total subnets under this VirtualNetwork
    var subnetList osacv1.SubnetList
    if err := r.List(ctx, &subnetList, client.MatchingLabels{
        "osac.openshift.io/virtual-network": subnet.Spec.VirtualNetwork,
    }); err != nil {
        return err
    }

    subnetCount := len(subnetList.Items)

**Placement Behavior:**

| Scenario | Subnet Count | CUDN Provisioned | VM Placement |
|----------|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| Single CUDN-backed subnet under VPC | 1 | ✅ Yes, CUDN and namespace READY | ✅ **Allowed** - Creates VM in CUDN namespace |
| First subnet with VMs, second+ added | 2+ | ✅ Yes (persists) | ❌ **Blocked** - VMaaS validation: subnet count > 1 |
| Multiple subnets, no VMs | 2+ | ✅ Yes (first subnet, persists) | ❌ **Blocked** - VMaaS validation: subnet count > 1 |
| Single subnet with skip annotation | 1 | ❌ No (explicit fabric-only) | ❌ **Blocked** - No CUDN to place VM into |
| Fabric-only subnet remains after deleting the CUDN-backed subnet | 1 | ❌ No; no automatic promotion | ❌ **Blocked** - Create a new VirtualNetwork with a CUDN-backed first Subnet |

**Error Messages:**

When a tenant attempts to create a VM in a VirtualNetwork with multiple subnets:

```
Error: Cannot create VM in Subnet "subnet-1": VirtualNetwork "vpc-1" has 2 subnets.
Phase 1 limitation: VMs require single subnet per VirtualNetwork.
Multiple subnets → VMs blocked in all subnets (bare-metal workloads only).

Solution: Delete extra subnets or create new VirtualNetwork with single subnet for VMs.
```

When a tenant attempts to add a second subnet while VMs exist:

```
Error (API): Cannot create additional subnets under VirtualNetwork "vpc-1":
first subnet "subnet-1" has running VMs.
Phase 1 limitation: cudn_evpn supports only one subnet per VirtualNetwork when VMs are present.

Solution: Delete VMs first or create a new VirtualNetwork for bare-metal workloads.
```

**Rationale:**
- Subnet count check is the primary validation (multiple subnets = no VMs)
- CUDN namespace existence is secondary (provisioning in progress vs complete)
- Fail-fast validation prevents VM provisioning errors
- Clear error messages guide tenant to correct topology
- Single subnet topology works seamlessly (CUDN always provisioned)

#### osac-operator: Sequential Provisioning

**Provisioning Package Extension:**

Sequential provisioning is implemented in the provisioning package (`pkg/provisioning/`) for reusability across controllers. The `JobTarget` struct is extended with dependency fields:

```go
// pkg/provisioning/types.go (new fields)
type JobTarget struct {
    Name                 string
    Provider             ProvisioningProvider
    Callbacks            PollCallbacks
    CheckAPIServer       bool
    AbsorbsLegacyHistory bool
    DependsOn            string                 // NEW: name of target that must complete first
    ExtraVarsFrom        string                 // NEW: name of target whose ConfigMap provides extra vars
    ExtraVarsConfigMap   string                 // NEW: ConfigMap name for output (created by fabric manager)
}
```

The `RunMultiTargetProvisioningLifecycle` function handles ordering generically:

```go
// pkg/provisioning/lifecycle.go (modified)
func RunMultiTargetProvisioningLifecycle(
    ctx context.Context,
    targets []JobTarget,
    callbacks TargetCallbacks,
) error {
    // Build dependency graph
    deps := buildDependencyGraph(targets)

    for _, target := range targets {
        // Gate dependent targets on their dependency's completion
        if target.DependsOn != "" {
            depTarget := findTargetByName(targets, target.DependsOn)
            if !isTargetComplete(depTarget, callbacks) {
                // Dependency not complete yet - skip this target, will eval next reconcile
                continue
            }

            // Extract output vars from dependency's ConfigMap and merge
            if target.ExtraVarsFrom != "" {
                extraVars, err := extractExtraVarsFromConfigMap(ctx, target.ExtraVarsFrom)
                if err != nil {
                    return fmt.Errorf("failed to extract extra vars from %s: %w", target.ExtraVarsFrom, err)
                }
                // Merge into target's extra vars
                for k, v := range extraVars {
                    target.ExtraVars[k] = v
                }
            }
        }

        // Run provisioning for this target (existing logic)
        if err := runTargetProvisioningLifecycle(ctx, target, callbacks); err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }

    return nil
}

func extractExtraVarsFromConfigMap(ctx context.Context, configMapName string) (map[string]interface{}, error) {
    // Fetch ConfigMap created by fabric manager
    cm := &corev1.ConfigMap{}
    if err := client.Get(ctx, client.ObjectKey{Namespace: "osac", Name: configMapName}, cm); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    // Parse JSON data from ConfigMap
    // Fabric manager writes: {"l2_vni": 14, "l3_vni": 11, "fabric_reserved_range": "200.200.1.1/32,200.200.1.100-200.200.1.200"}
    var extraVars map[string]interface{}
    if err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(cm.Data["extra_vars"]), &extraVars); err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to parse ConfigMap data: %w", err)
    }

    return extraVars, nil
}
```

**Subnet Controller Usage:**

The controller auto-detects whether to provision k8s manager based on existing Subnets:

```go
// internal/controller/subnet_controller.go (modified)
func (r *SubnetReconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req reconcile.Request) (reconcile.Result, error) {
    subnet := &osacv1.Subnet{}
    if err := r.Get(ctx, req.NamespacedName, subnet); err != nil {
        return reconcile.Result{}, client.IgnoreNotFound(err)
    }

    // Dispatch to fabric + k8s managers
    plan, err := r.Dispatcher.Dispatch(ctx, "Subnet", getNetworkClassID(subnet))
    if err != nil {
        return reconcile.Result{}, err
    }

    // Determine if k8s manager should be skipped (fabric-only provisioning)
    skipK8sManager, err := r.shouldSkipK8sManager(ctx, subnet)
    if err != nil {
        return reconcile.Result{}, err
    }

    // Build targets with dependencies
    var targets []provisioning.JobTarget
    for _, dispatchTarget := range plan.Targets {
        // Skip k8s manager target if explicit annotation OR auto-detected
        if dispatchTarget.Role == dispatcher.K8sManager && skipK8sManager {
            continue
        }

        target := provisioning.JobTarget{
            Name:         dispatchTarget.TemplateName,
            TemplateName: dispatchTarget.TemplateName,
            ExtraVars:    dispatchTarget.ExtraVars,
            // ... other fields ...
        }

        // If this is a k8s manager and a fabric manager exists, add dependency
        if dispatchTarget.Role == dispatcher.K8sManager {
            fabricTarget := plan.GetFabricTarget()
            if fabricTarget != nil {
                target.DependsOn = fabricTarget.TemplateName
                target.ExtraVarsFrom = fmt.Sprintf("subnet-%s-fabric-output", subnet.GetName())
                // Fabric manager will create this ConfigMap with VNI data
            }
        }

        // If this is a fabric manager, specify output ConfigMap
        if dispatchTarget.Role == dispatcher.FabricManager {
            target.ExtraVarsConfigMap = fmt.Sprintf("subnet-%s-fabric-output", subnet.GetName())
        }

        targets = append(targets, target)
    }

    // Provisioning package handles ordering generically
    return provisioning.RunMultiTargetProvisioningLifecycle(ctx, targets, r.buildCallbacks(subnet))
}

func (r *SubnetReconciler) shouldSkipK8sManager(ctx context.Context, subnet *osacv1.Subnet) (bool, error) {
    // Check explicit annotation first (takes precedence)
    if subnet.GetAnnotations()["osac.openshift.io/skip-k8s-manager"] == "true" {
        return true, nil
    }

    // Auto-detect: count total Subnets under this VirtualNetwork
    // Phase 1 limitation: only single-subnet VirtualNetworks support VMs (CUDN provisioning)
    // - First subnet (alone) → CUDN provisioned
    // - Second+ subnets → no CUDN provisioned (fabric-only)
    var subnetList osacv1.SubnetList
    if err := r.List(ctx, &subnetList, client.MatchingLabels{
        "osac.openshift.io/virtual-network": subnet.Spec.VirtualNetwork,
    }); err != nil {
        return false, err
    }

    subnetCount := len(subnetList.Items)

    // If multiple subnets exist, skip k8s manager (fabric-only)
    // First subnet's CUDN persists, but no new CUDNs provisioned
    if subnetCount > 1 {
        return true, nil  // Skip k8s manager (second+ subnet, fabric-only)
    }

    // First subnet (alone) → provision CUDN
    return false, nil  // Do not skip k8s manager
}

func getNetworkClassID(subnet *osacv1.Subnet) string {
    // Subnet CR references VirtualNetwork, which has osac.openshift.io/network-class-id annotation
    // Dispatcher uses this annotation to resolve the NetworkClass
    // (Annotation is set by VirtualNetwork feedback controller when VN is created)
    return subnet.Annotations["osac.openshift.io/network-class-id"]
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Auto-detection: only first Subnet (when alone) gets CUDN provisioned
- Subnet count check (simple and predictable): count > 1 → skip k8s manager for all new subnets
- **First subnet's CUDN persists** when second+ subnets added (operator doesn't delete it)
- Second+ subnets: operator skips k8s manager entirely (fabric-only, no CUDN provisioned)
- Explicit skip annotation overrides auto-detection (for first-subnet fabric-only case)
- Sequential logic in provisioning package (not controller) makes it reusable for ANY future fabric→k8s dependency
- Controllers declaratively specify dependencies via `DependsOn` and `ExtraVarsFrom` fields
- ConfigMap data path is explicit and verified (not an assumption like AAP Job CR status.extraVars)
- Fabric manager creates ConfigMap with output, k8s manager consumes it — manager-agnostic interface
- [Research: §Sequential Provisioning Patterns] [PRD: In Scope — fabric-to-k8s data dependency]

#### osac-aap: Fabric Manager Role

This design extends the existing physical fabric manager role (`collections/ansible_collections/osac/templates/roles/fabric_manager/`) with VirtualNetwork and Subnet provisioning tasks. Under the shared OSAC-1433 contract, the configured fabric manager owns provisioning and enforcement of the independent NetworkACL resource and reports when the policy associated with a Subnet is active. A NetworkACL is scoped to one VirtualNetwork and may be reused by multiple Subnets; the fabric manager does not create a child ACL resource for each Subnet. The CUDN/K8s manager receives subnet network-segment data only and does not implement ACL behavior. Existing ExternalIP and NATGateway provisioning tasks remain unchanged.

**New Task Files:**

```
collections/ansible_collections/osac/templates/roles/fabric_manager/tasks/
├── create_virtual_network.yaml      # NEW: Create fabric manager VPC, return L3 VNI

└── delete_subnet.yaml               # NEW: Delete fabric manager VNet
```

The existing `meta/osac.yaml` already declares `fabric_manager: primary` with capabilities — no changes needed there. For reference, the existing schema:

```

**Rationale:**
- **Provisioning timing:** Both VPC and VNet created during Subnet provisioning (not VirtualNetwork provisioning)
- fabric manager VPC (ipVRF) maps to VirtualNetwork (L3 VNI for cross-subnet routing via fabric)
- fabric manager VNet (macVRF) maps to Subnet (L2 VNI for same-subnet bridging)
- **VPC created idempotently:** First Subnet creates VPC + VNet, second+ Subnets reuse existing VPC (create/get pattern)
- **Both VNIs extracted:** L2 VNI from VNet creation, L3 VNI from VPC creation/get → both passed to CUDN
- **ConfigMap data path** (not set_stats → AAP Job CR) — verified approach, set_stats does not populate Job CR status.extraVars
- Generic field names (`fabric_reserved_range`, not `fabric_manager_reserved_range`) make the output contract reusable by other fabric managers
- Route targets not returned in Phase 1 - CUDN auto-generates as "AS:VNI"
- **Reserved range (fabric_reserved_range) is mandatory output** — prevents OVN IPAM collision with fabric SVIs and DHCP (correctness bug if missing)
- K8s manager validates reserved range presence and fails if missing
- fabric manager SVI owns the gateway IP — EVPN CUDNs delegate L3 routing to fabric (no OVN logical router port created)

**Rationale:**
- **Namespace name = Subnet name** (simple mapping, no prefix needed)
- **CUDN name = VirtualNetwork name** (Phase 1 supports VM placement only on single-Subnet VirtualNetworks; an existing CUDN may persist if the VirtualNetwork later becomes fabric-only)
- CUDN namespaceSelector matches by `virtual-network` label (selects namespace(s) for this VirtualNetwork)
- Namespace label `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` required for UDN as primary network
- Namespace label `osac.openshift.io/k8s-manager: "cudn_evpn"` identifies which manager owns the namespace
- VTEP reference = `tenant-vtep` (cluster singleton, installation prerequisite)
- VNI values (L2 macVRF, L3 ipVRF) from extra_vars (passed by provisioning package from fabric ConfigMap output)
- Route targets omitted in Phase 1 — CUDN auto-generates as "AS:VNI" (Phase 2 multi-cluster may require explicit RT control for inter-cluster route distribution)
- Wait for CUDN Ready before completing (prevents race with VM provisioning)
- **reservedSubnets (REQUIRED)** set to fabric_reserved_range — prevents OVN IPAM from allocating IPs in fabric-managed range (SVIs, DHCP) — mandatory for correctness (collision causes connectivity failure)
- Validation fails k8s job if fabric_reserved_range missing from fabric job ConfigMap (generic name works with any fabric manager)
- defaultGatewayIPs omitted — OVN auto-picks .1, which fabric SVI answers (documented working behavior)
- set_stats publishes CUDN details (used by controller for status update, not for inter-job flow)
- [Demo: Phase 5.2 CUDN structure] [Research: §Existing Solutions — OVN-K CUDN]

**Subnet Controller Pre-Delete Validation:**

The Subnet controller (not the playbook) enforces deletion ordering and VM validation:

```go
// internal/controller/subnet_controller.go
func (r *SubnetReconciler) handleDelete(ctx context.Context, subnet *osacv1.Subnet) (reconcile.Result, error) {
    virtualNetworkID := subnet.Spec.VirtualNetwork

    // Serialize deletion admission with Subnet creation and VM placement.
    unlock, err := r.admission.Acquire(ctx, virtualNetworkID)
    if err != nil {
        return reconcile.Result{RequeueAfter: 30 * time.Second}, err
    }
    defer unlock()

    // Read or create the durable deletion reservation while holding the shared lock.
    state, err := r.admission.GetSubnetDeletionState(ctx, virtualNetworkID, subnet.GetUID())
    if err != nil {
        return reconcile.Result{}, err
    }
    if state == "Admitted" {
        // The finalizer keeps the reservation active until manager cleanup completes.
        return r.runDeprovisionJob(ctx, subnet)
    }
    if state == "None" {
        // Fence new Subnet creates and VM placements before waiting for existing work.
        if err := r.admission.BeginSubnetDeletionRequest(ctx, virtualNetworkID, subnet.GetUID()); err != nil {
            return reconcile.Result{}, err
        }
    }

    // Check authoritative admissions, including placements with no VM object yet.
    placements, err := r.admission.ListActiveVMPlacements(ctx, virtualNetworkID)
    if err != nil {
        return reconcile.Result{}, err
    }
    if len(placements) > 0 {
        r.Recorder.Event(subnet, corev1.EventTypeWarning, "DeletionBlocked",
            fmt.Sprintf("Cannot deprovision Subnet: %d active or in-progress VM placements remain", len(placements)))
        return reconcile.Result{RequeueAfter: 30 * time.Second}, nil
    }

    // Also check VM objects as a defensive consistency check.
    namespaceName := subnet.GetName() // Namespace name = Subnet name
    namespace := &corev1.Namespace{}
    hasCUDN := false
    if err := r.Get(ctx, client.ObjectKey{Name: namespaceName}, namespace); err == nil {
        hasCUDN = true
    } else if !apierrors.IsNotFound(err) {
        return reconcile.Result{}, err
    }
    if hasCUDN {
        vmList := &kubevirtv1.VirtualMachineList{}
        if err := r.List(ctx, vmList, client.InNamespace(namespaceName)); err != nil {
            return reconcile.Result{}, err
        }
        if len(vmList.Items) > 0 {
            r.Recorder.Event(subnet, corev1.EventTypeWarning, "DeletionBlocked",
                fmt.Sprintf("Cannot deprovision Subnet with CUDN: %d VMs remain in namespace %s", len(vmList.Items), namespaceName))
            return reconcile.Result{RequeueAfter: 30 * time.Second}, nil
        }
    }

    // No placements or VM objects remain. Promote the durable reservation while
    // still holding the lock, then start the asynchronous cleanup job.
    if err := r.admission.AdmitSubnetDeletion(ctx, virtualNetworkID, subnet.GetUID()); err != nil {
        return reconcile.Result{}, err
    }
    // The reservation fences new work while the distributed lease is released
    // after this reconcile; retain it across deprovisioning retries.
    return r.runDeprovisionJob(ctx, subnet)
}
```

**Deletion Rationale:**
- **CUDN check first:** Determines if subnet has k8s networking (namespace exists)
- **VM validation (CUDN subnets only):** Block deletion if VMs running — enforces correct deletion order (VMs → Subnet)
- **Controller validation** (not playbook) enforces VM deletion prerequisite — separation of concerns (ComputeInstance controller owns VM lifecycle)
- **Fabric-only subnets:** Skip VM check (no CUDN = no VMs possible), proceed directly to fabric deprovision
- **CUDN subnets:** Playbook deletes CUDN → wait fully deleted → namespace, then fabric deprovision
- **CUDN wait for full deletion** (not just deletionTimestamp) ensures OVN has released VNI before fabric deprovision
- **Fabric deprovision after CUDN deleted** mitigates VNI reuse race (fabric manager may reuse VNI if VNet deleted while CUDN still exists)
- Namespace delete safe after CUDN gone (no finalizer race)
- **Stale VRF recovery (if needed):** See Support Procedures — manual troubleshooting step, not automated (ovnkube-node restart affects all VMs on node, too disruptive for routine delete)

**VirtualNetwork Deletion with Multiple Subnets:**

When a VirtualNetwork has multiple Subnets, deletion must follow this order:

1. **User deletes VirtualNetwork CR**
2. **VirtualNetwork controller blocks deletion** until all child Subnets are deleted (enforced via Kubernetes finalizer)
3. **Subnets must be deleted individually first:**
   - **First Subnet (has CUDN):** k8s manager deprovision (CUDN + namespace) → fabric deprovision (fabric manager VNet)
   - **Second+ Subnets (no CUDN):** fabric deprovision only (fabric manager VNet, no k8s resources to clean up)
   - **Any Subnet with `skip-k8s-manager` annotation:** fabric deprovision only (fabric manager VNet)
4. **After all Subnets deleted:** VirtualNetwork finalizer clears, fabric manager deprovision runs (deletes fabric manager VPC)

**Deletion Detection:**
- Controller checks if namespace exists (namespace name = subnet name)
- If namespace exists → Subnet has CUDN → run k8s deprovision job
- If namespace not found → Subnet is fabric-only → skip k8s deprovision, run fabric deprovision only

**Critical constraint:** fabric manager API rejects VPC deletion if any VNets exist under it. The VirtualNetwork fabric manager playbook must validate no child VNets exist before deleting VPC:

```yaml
# osac-aap fabric_manager role: tasks/delete_virtual_network.yaml
- name: Check for orphaned VNets before VPC deletion
  fabric_manager.controller.vnet_info:
    vpc: "{{ vpc_name }}"
  register: vnet_list

- name: Fail if VNets still exist (indicates Subnet finalizer didn't run)
  ansible.builtin.fail:
    msg: "Cannot delete VPC {{ vpc_name }} - {{ vnet_list.vnets | length }} VNets still exist. Delete all Subnets first."
  when: vnet_list.vnets | length > 0

- name: Delete fabric manager VPC
  fabric_manager.controller.vpc:
    name: "{{ vpc_name }}"
    state: absent
```

**Kubernetes finalizer logic** ensures proper ordering:
- VirtualNetwork has finalizer `osac.openshift.io/fabric-resources`
- Controller checks for child Subnets (via label selector `osac.openshift.io/virtual-network: <vn-name>`)
- If Subnets exist → requeue, do not remove finalizer
- After all Subnets deleted → run fabric deprovision → remove finalizer
- ✅ Works with mixed subnets (annotation checked per-Subnet during their own deletion)

**FRRConfiguration Handling:**

FRRConfiguration for underlay BGP peering is created during installation (manual prerequisite). The k8s manager does **not** create or modify FRRConfiguration. OVN-Kubernetes auto-updates FRR config when CUDN with `evpn: "true"` label is created.

Per demo Phase 5.3:
> "On CUDN creation, BGP FRR configuration is updated... advertise-all-vni"

The RouteAdvertisements CR (installation prerequisite) defines `frrConfigurationSelector: {matchLabels: {evpn: "true"}}`, which tells OVN-K to update any FRRConfiguration with that label when a CUDN with matching label appears.

**Assumption:** Installation-time FRRConfiguration exists in `openshift-frr-k8s` namespace with label `evpn: "true"`. K8s manager only creates CUDN; FRR integration is declarative via label matching.

[Demo: Phase 2.6 FRRConfiguration, Phase 2.5 RouteAdvertisements] [Research: §FRR Operator — advertiseVNIs]

**DHCP Coexistence:**

Both fabric manager and OVN run DHCP servers for the same subnet:
- **fabric manager DHCP:** Enabled by default on VNet creation (e.g., 200.200.1.50-254)
- **OVN DHCP:** Runs inside the logical switch for the CUDN subnet

**Observed behavior (validated in testing):**
OVN intercepts DHCP requests inside the logical switch before they reach the fabric. VMs receive IP addresses from OVN DHCP and never see fabric manager DHCP offers. The two DHCP servers coexist safely without conflict.

**IP allocation strategy (REQUIRED for correctness):**
- **`excludeSubnets` is mandatory** — prevents OVN IPAM from allocating IPs in the fabric-reserved range (SVIs + DHCP pool)
- Without `excludeSubnets`, OVN may allocate IPs that the fabric owns (e.g., gateway .1, SVI IPs, DHCP pool) causing connectivity failures
- Fabric manager must return `fabric_reserved_range` in ConfigMap output (e.g., `200.200.1.0/26` for SVIs + DHCP low range) — the generic name works with any compatible fabric manager
- K8s manager validates `fabric_reserved_range` presence and fails provisioning if missing (prevents silent collision)

**Operational notes:**
- fabric manager DHCP can remain enabled (no configuration change needed) — it serves bare-metal nodes on the fabric
- OVN DHCP serves only VMs in the CUDN namespace (encapsulated traffic never reaches fabric manager DHCP)
- For clarity in troubleshooting, consider disabling fabric manager DHCP for EVPN-bridged VNets (optional)

[Testing: Validated in demo environment — VM receives IP from OVN, fabric manager DHCP logs show no requests from VM MAC]

**Gateway Ownership (Critical Architecture Decision):**

EVPN CUDNs with `transport: EVPN` do **not** create an OVN logical router port for the gateway. This is fundamentally different from LocalNet CUDNs.

**What happens:**
1. OVN DHCP provides a gateway IP to VMs (e.g., 200.200.1.1)
2. **No OVN logical router port exists for that IP**
3. VM ARPs for the gateway → ARP request is bridged to the fabric via EVPN Type-2 route
4. **fabric manager SVI answers the ARP** (fabric manager owns the gateway IP, advertises it via EVPN)
5. VM sends L3 traffic to the gateway MAC (fabric manager SVI MAC)
6. Traffic is encapsulated (VXLAN) and forwarded to the fabric switch
7. Fabric switch decapsulates and routes (ipVRF)

**Consequence:**
Without a fabric gateway (fabric manager SVI), VMs have **L2 connectivity only** — no L3 routing. The gateway IP in CUDN's `defaultGatewayIPs` (or auto-picked .1) must be owned by the fabric, not OVN.

**Phase 1 behavior:**
- `defaultGatewayIPs` omitted from CUDN spec
- OVN auto-picks .1 as gateway IP (advertised via DHCP)
- fabric manager SVI must be configured to own .1 (manual prerequisite, validated in demo)
- If fabric manager SVI is not configured with the same IP, VMs cannot route off-subnet

**Why this architecture:**
EVPN transport delegates routing to the fabric. OVN provides L2 switching only (macVRF). The fabric provides L3 routing (ipVRF). This is by design for fabric-integrated VM networking.

**Contrast with LocalNet:**
- LocalNet CUDNs create an OVN distributed logical router (DLR) port
- OVN owns the gateway IP, handles routing
- No fabric dependency for L3 traffic

**Validation:**
Demo environment confirmed: OVN logical router has no port for the CUDN subnet. `ovn-nbctl show` does not list the gateway IP. fabric manager SVI owns it exclusively.

[Demo: Phase 5 CUDN creation, Phase 7 same-Subnet VM-to-fabric L2 test] [Testing: Validated — no OVN logical router port created, fabric manager SVI answers gateway ARP]

#### osac-installer: K8s Manager Registration

**New ConfigMap:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: k8s-manager-cudn-evpn
  namespace: osac
  labels:
    osac.openshift.io/network-k8s-manager: "true"  # Matches OSAC-1433 label path
data:
  name: cudn_evpn  # Field name 'name' per OSAC-1433 schema (not 'manager')
  description: "OVN-Kubernetes CUDN with EVPN transport for VM-to-fabric bridging (IPv4 only)"
  capabilities: "ipv4"  # Standard manager capability token per OSAC-1433
  # template_role field removed - not in OSAC-1433 spec, dispatcher resolves role name from k8s_manager field
```

**Capability Fields:**
- `ipv4` — IPv4 address family supported; IPv6 and dual-stack are not supported
- The VM topology constraint is enforced by fulfillment-service and VMaaS:
  additional Subnets are rejected while VMs exist, and VM placement is
  rejected when the VirtualNetwork has multiple Subnets. It is not a custom
  manager capability token.

**RBAC:**

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: osac-aap-cudn-evpn
rules:
- apiGroups: ["k8s.ovn.org"]
  resources: ["clusteruserdefinednetworks"]
  verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "watch", "update", "patch", "delete"]
- apiGroups: ["k8s.ovn.org"]
  resources: ["vteps"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]  # Read-only, VTEP is prerequisite
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: osac-aap-cudn-evpn
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: osac-aap-cudn-evpn
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: osac-aap-runner  # AAP job execution SA
  namespace: osac
```

**Rationale:**
- ConfigMap registration follows existing pattern (cudn_localnet)
- RBAC grants CUDN create/delete, VTEP read-only
- No FRRConfiguration RBAC needed (not created by k8s manager)
- [Codebase: osac/osac-installer/charts/osac/templates/k8s-manager-*.yaml]


### Security Considerations

**Tenant Isolation:**

All OSAC resources include standard tenant isolation metadata:
- `osac.openshift.io/tenant` annotation on CUDN and namespace
- `osac.openshift.io/owner-reference` annotation linking CUDN to parent VirtualNetwork
- OPA policies enforce read/write isolation at fulfillment-service API layer

**New Isolation Boundary:**

CUDN namespace selector uses `matchLabels: {virtual-network: "<vnet-name>"}`. VM placement is supported only when a VirtualNetwork has exactly one Subnet, which has one CUDN namespace. A multi-Subnet VirtualNetwork is fabric-only and rejects VM placement. VMs in different VirtualNetworks cannot communicate at L2 or L3 (separate macVRF + ipVRF).

**BGP Security:**

Underlay BGP session (OCP ↔ fabric switch) uses MD5 authentication (configured during installation, not managed by OSAC). FRRConfiguration credentials stored in Kubernetes Secret.

**No New Attack Surface:**

- CUDN and FRRConfiguration are cluster-scoped CRDs, not tenant-facing APIs
- Tenants interact only via fulfillment-service Subnet API (existing auth/authz)
- AAP jobs run with service account (RBAC-controlled), not tenant credentials

**Input Validation:**

VNI values from fabric manager are integers (validated by CUDN CRD schema). Route target strings validated by FRR (rejected if malformed). Subnet CIDR validated by fulfillment-service (existing validation).

### Failure Handling and Recovery

**Fabric Job Failure:**

- **What happens:** fabric manager API error, VNet already exists, quota exceeded
- **Recovery:** Controller requeues Subnet reconciliation, retries fabric job after backoff
- **User observes:** Subnet.status.phase = "Failed", Subnet.status.conditions show fabric job error

**VNI Extraction Failure:**

- **What happens:** Fabric job succeeds but set_stats missing VNI data, or AAP Job CR not found
- **Recovery:** Controller marks Subnet as Failed with event "VNIExtractionFailed"
- **User observes:** Must inspect fabric job logs (AAP UI) to diagnose, then delete/recreate Subnet

**K8s Job Failure:**

- **What happens:** CUDN creation rejected (VNI collision, VTEP not found, invalid route target)
- **Recovery:** Controller requeues, retries k8s job after backoff
- **User observes:** Subnet.status.phase = "Failed", check AAP job logs for CUDN API error

**CUDN VNI Collision:**

- **What happens:** First-Subnet provisioning for two distinct VirtualNetworks receives the same VNI, so the second CUDN is rejected by OVN-K
- **Recovery:** No automatic recovery — the conflicting Subnet remains failed until a unique VNI is available and provisioning is retried
- **Mitigation:** The configured fabric manager must guarantee cluster-wide VNI uniqueness
- **User observes:** One VirtualNetwork's first Subnet fails with "VNI 14 already in use"; adding a fabric-only second Subnet does not create another CUDN

**Controller Restart Mid-Reconciliation:**

- **What happens:** Controller crashes after fabric job completes, before k8s job starts
- **Recovery:** Idempotent reconciliation — controller re-reads Subnet status, detects fabric job complete, proceeds to k8s job
- **User observes:** No impact, reconciliation resumes

**Partial Cleanup (Delete Subnet):**

- **What happens:** CUDN deleted but fabric manager VNet delete fails
- **Recovery:** Finalizer blocks Subnet deletion until fabric manager cleanup succeeds
- **User observes:** Subnet stuck in "Terminating" state, check fabric manager logs

**OVN-K CUDN Not Ready:**

- **What happens:** CUDN created but OVN-K cannot provision (namespace missing, VTEP down)
- **Recovery:** K8s manager playbook waits for CUDN Ready condition (30 retries × 10s = 5 min timeout), then fails job
- **User observes:** AAP job timeout, check OVN-K operator logs

### RBAC / Tenancy

**Tenant Isolation Enforced:**

- fulfillment-service API: OPA policies filter Subnet list/get by `osac.openshift.io/tenant` annotation
- CUDN and namespace: labeled with `osac.openshift.io/tenant` for traceability (not enforced by K8s RBAC — cluster-scoped CRDs are admin-only)
- VMs: deployed into tenant namespace, NetworkPolicy can further restrict (out of scope)

**No RBAC Changes:**

Existing RBAC model applies. Tenant users interact via fulfillment-service API (gRPC/REST). CUDN and FRRConfiguration are cluster-scoped, created by AAP service account, not directly accessible to tenants.

**Owner Reference Annotations:**

- CUDN annotation `osac.openshift.io/owner-reference: "VirtualNetwork/<vnet-id>"` links to parent
- Used for garbage collection: deleting VirtualNetwork cascades to CUDN via finalizer

### Observability and Monitoring

**New Metrics:**

- `osac_subnet_reconcile_duration_seconds{manager="fabric_manager|cudn_evpn"}` — histogram of reconciliation time per manager
- `osac_subnet_vni_extraction_errors_total` — counter of VNI extraction failures
- `osac_subnet_sequential_provisioning_wait_seconds` — gauge of time between fabric job complete and k8s job start

**New Kubernetes Events:**

- `VNIExtractionFailed` (Warning): fabric job succeeded but VNI data missing/invalid
- `K8sManagerWaitingForFabric` (Normal): k8s job waiting for fabric job to complete
- `CUDNProvisioningFailed` (Warning): CUDN creation rejected by OVN-K

**Existing Mechanisms:**

- Subnet status conditions (existing): `Provisioned`, `Failed`, `Deleting`
- AAP job history in Subnet.status.jobHistory (existing): shows fabric and k8s job names, phases

**No New Alerts:**

Existing alerts on `osac_subnet_reconcile_failures_total` cover this feature. Threshold: >5% failure rate over 5min indicates systemic issue.

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **VNI allocation race condition** — concurrent first-Subnet provisioning in distinct VirtualNetworks receives the same VNI | The configured fabric manager guarantees cluster-wide VNI uniqueness atomically. Real risk is VNI reuse during delete+recreate: mitigated by fabric deprovision only after CUDN fully deleted (not just deletionTimestamp set) |
| **Gateway MAC mismatch** — manual coordination step skipped, L3 traffic breaks | Document prerequisite clearly in installation guide, add diagnostic command to compare MACs (kubectl + fabric API) |
| **VTEP not created** — k8s manager assumes VTEP exists, CUDN creation fails | Installation validation script checks VTEP exists before allowing NetworkClass with k8s_manager=cudn_evpn |
| **Fabric output data loss** — fabric job completes but ConfigMap deleted before provisioning package reads it | ConfigMap persists in osac namespace (durable), k8s manager fails if ConfigMap missing (explicit error, not silent failure). ConfigMap cleaned up by fabric manager delete playbook after deprovision. |
| **IPv4-only regression** — future IPv6 support breaks existing CUDNs | CUDN VNI is immutable (delete+recreate required), no in-place upgrade |
| **FRRConfiguration conflict** — multiple OSAC installations on same cluster, label collision | Installation guide warns against multi-instance deployments, OR use namespace-scoped FRRConfiguration selector |
| **Dual DHCP confusion** — both fabric and OVN run DHCP, unclear which serves VMs | Documented behavior: OVN intercepts DHCP inside logical switch, VMs never see fabric DHCP. Both coexist safely. |
| **cudn_evpn coupled to fabric manager-specific outputs** — k8s manager expects fabric manager VPC/VNet concepts, won't work with other fabric managers | Generic output contract (`l2_vni`, `l3_vni`, `fabric_reserved_range`) defined for fabric→k8s data flow. Any compatible fabric manager can provide this contract without k8s manager changes. The configured fabric manager role is the first implementation of the contract. |

### Drawbacks

**Manual Prerequisites:**

Cloud Infrastructure Admin must configure VTEP, FRRConfiguration, BGP underlay, and gateway MAC coordination before tenants can use this feature. High operational complexity compared to CUDN LocalNet (which required only nmstate, no BGP).

**Trade-off justification:** EVPN scalability (millions of VNIs vs 4096 VLANs) and multi-cluster support (Phase 2) outweigh the installation burden for large deployments.

**Single-Subnet Limitation:**

Only the first Subnet under a VirtualNetwork receives CUDN (for VM workloads). Second+ Subnets are fabric-only (bare-metal workloads). VMaaS prevents VM placement in fabric-only subnets.

**Trade-off justification:** OVN Connectors (inter-subnet routing) and OVN-K secondary CUDN support (multi-NIC VMs) are pending. Phase 1 delivers single-cluster EVPN bridging with one CUDN per VirtualNetwork. Phase 2 will enable: (1) OVN Connectors for inter-subnet routing between VMs, (2) OVN-K secondary CUDN support for multi-NIC VMs (one NIC per subnet).

**Sequential Provisioning Latency:**

Subnet provisioning takes 2× the time of parallel provisioning (fabric job + k8s job serially instead of concurrently).

**Trade-off justification:** Data dependency requires sequencing. Measured overhead: ~30s fabric job + ~20s k8s job = ~50s total (vs ~30s parallel). Acceptable for infrequent Subnet creates.

## Alternatives (Not Implemented)

### Alternative 1: Unified AAP Workflow Template

**Approach:** Create single workflow template (`osac-create-subnet-fabric-k8s`) that calls fabric manager role, extracts VNI via set_stats, then calls cudn_evpn role within same AAP workflow.

**Pros:**
- set_stats data flow works natively (no controller VNI extraction)
- Simpler controller logic (single job instead of two)

**Cons:**
- Breaks dispatcher plugin architecture — NetworkClass can no longer route to arbitrary fabric/k8s manager combinations
- Hard-codes fabric manager + cudn_evpn coupling (not extensible to other fabric managers)
- AAP workflow template is more complex than individual role templates

**Rejection reason:** Preserving dispatcher extensibility is a design goal. Sequential provisioning at controller level keeps roles decoupled.

[Research: §Recommended Approach — why not unified workflow template]

### Alternative 2: Operator Webhook for Subnet Validation

**Approach:** Use osac-operator admission webhook instead of fulfillment-service API validation for single-subnet constraint.

**Pros:**
- Co-located with CUDN knowledge (can check Kubernetes API for existing CUDNs)
- Validation logic stays in operator

**Cons:**
- Webhook is async — API returns 201 Created, then webhook rejects, CR never provisions
- Poor UX: user sees successful API response, then Subnet stuck in Failed state
- Webhook must query fulfillment-service API to get parent VirtualNetwork's NetworkClass (cross-component dependency)

**Rejection reason:** Service-side validation provides immediate error feedback (400 Bad Request). Webhook validation adds latency and UX confusion.

### Alternative 3: k8s Manager Creates Per-Subnet FRRConfiguration

**Approach:** Each Subnet creates its own FRRConfiguration with VNI-specific route targets instead of relying on installation-time global FRRConfiguration.

**Pros:**
- Tenant-scoped FRRConfiguration lifecycle (delete Subnet → delete FRRConfiguration)
- No shared state between tenants in FRR config

**Cons:**
- FRRConfiguration merging is additive — multiple configs per node are allowed but increase reconciliation complexity
- Underlay BGP neighbor config must be duplicated in every FRRConfiguration (copy-paste from installation template)
- Research shows advertiseVNIs can reference multiple VNIs from one FRRConfiguration

**Rejection reason:** Installation-time FRRConfiguration with advertiseVNIs: All is simpler and follows demo pattern. OVN-K auto-updates FRR when CUDN appears.

[Demo: Phase 2.6 global FRRConfiguration, Phase 5.3 auto-update]

## Open Questions

### 1. Gateway MAC Coordination Mechanism

**Owner:** Cloud Infrastructure Admin (installation documentation owner)

**Impact:** Prerequisites documentation (§Test Plan)

Where is the authoritative MAC value? Does fabric manager VNet gateway MAC come from a pool (predictable), or is it random? Does CUDN gateway MAC come from a configurable field, or auto-generated? If both are random, manual coordination is impossible.

**Assumption:** Both sides support deterministic MAC generation or explicit MAC configuration. [Assumption]

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests

**fulfillment-service (Go + Ginkgo):**

- `internal/servers/subnet_server_test.go`:
  - Subnet creation succeeds for first Subnet with a READY NetworkACL explicitly associated in the same VirtualNetwork
  - Subnet creation succeeds for second Subnet when no active or in-progress VM placements exist and both Subnets explicitly reference a READY ACL in the same VirtualNetwork
  - Subnet creation fails (400 Bad Request / FailedPrecondition) when active or in-progress VM placements exist and a second Subnet is requested
  - Error message identifies active VM placements and says to delete VMs first or create a new VirtualNetwork
  - Subnet creation fails when the NetworkACL association is missing, not READY, or scoped to another VirtualNetwork
  - Subnet creation succeeds with skip-k8s-manager annotation

**osac-operator (Go + Ginkgo):**

- `internal/controller/subnet_controller_test.go`:
  - Auto-detection (single subnet): provisions fabric + k8s manager (CUDN created)
  - Auto-detection (multiple subnets present before provisioning): provisions fabric-only and creates no CUDN
  - Adding a second Subnet after the first CUDN is provisioned: keeps the existing CUDN, provisions the new Subnet fabric-only, and blocks all VM placement in that VirtualNetwork
  - Auto-detection: subnet count check determines whether to skip k8s manager for the Subnet being reconciled
  - Explicit skip annotation: subnet provisions fabric-only even if single subnet
  - Sequential provisioning: fabric job runs first, k8s job waits for fabric completion
  - Sequential provisioning: VNI extraction from fabric ConfigMap extracts correct l2_vni, l3_vni, fabric_reserved_range
  - Sequential provisioning: VNI extraction fails if fabric ConfigMap missing data, reconcile returns error with VNIExtractionFailed event
  - Sequential provisioning: k8s job receives VNI data and reserved range in extraVars
  - Parallel provisioning fallback when only fabric manager exists (no k8s manager in NetworkClass)
  - Controller restart mid-provisioning resumes from fabric job complete state
  - **Deletion validation (active or in-progress placement admission, no VM object yet):** persists a `Requested` reservation, blocks new admissions, emits `DeletionBlocked`, and requeues without starting deprovisioning
  - **Deletion validation (CUDN subnet with VMs):** retains the `Requested` reservation, emits `DeletionBlocked`, and requeues
  - **Deletion validation (CUDN subnet no placements or VMs):** transitions the reservation to `Admitted` under the VirtualNetwork lock and starts deprovisioning
  - **Deletion admission fence:** both reservation states block new VM placements and Subnet creates until deprovisioning completes and the finalizer is removed
  - **Deletion validation (fabric-only subnet):** deletion proceeds directly, no VM check

**VMaaS (Go + Ginkgo):**

- `internal/controller/computeinstance_controller_test.go`:
  - VM creation succeeds only when the VirtualNetwork has one Subnet and that Subnet's CUDN and namespace are READY
  - VM creation fails (validation error) when multiple Subnets exist, even if the first Subnet's CUDN persists
  - Error message includes subnet count and "requires single subnet for VMs"
  - VM creation fails when the target is a single fabric-only Subnet or its CUDN namespace is missing/not READY
  - VM creation remains blocked when deleting the CUDN-backed Subnet leaves a fabric-only Subnet; no automatic promotion occurs

**osac-aap (Ansible + ansible-test):**

- `collections/ansible_collections/osac/templates/roles/fabric_manager/`:
  - `create_subnet.yaml` creates/fetches fabric manager VPC for VirtualNetwork
  - `create_subnet.yaml` creates fabric manager VNet with correct CIDR
  - `create_subnet.yaml` publishes VNI data via ConfigMap (l2_vni, l3_vni, fabric_reserved_range)
  - **Integration test must verify ConfigMap data path** (verified: set_stats does NOT populate AAP Job CR status.extraVars)
  - `delete_subnet.yaml` deletes fabric manager VNet, VPC remains

- `collections/ansible_collections/osac/templates/roles/cudn_evpn/`:
  - `create_subnet.yaml` creates namespace with k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network label
  - `create_subnet.yaml` creates CUDN with correct VNI values and excludeSubnets from extra_vars
  - `create_subnet.yaml` waits for CUDN Ready condition before completing
  - `create_subnet.yaml` sets tenant and owner-reference annotations on CUDN
  - `delete_subnet.yaml` enforces deletion order: VMs → wait for VMIs terminated → CUDN → namespace
  - Stale VRF recovery (if needed) is manual — see Support Procedures (not automated due to ovnkube-node restart impact)

### Integration Tests

**osac-operator (envtest - Kind cluster):**

- Create NetworkClass with fabric_manager="primary", k8s_manager="cudn_evpn"
- Create VirtualNetwork and a READY same-VirtualNetwork NetworkACL; create a Subnet with its explicit `network_acl` association and verify the dispatcher plan includes both fabric and k8s targets
- Mock fabric job completion and a ConfigMap `data.extra_vars` value containing `l2_vni`, `l3_vni`, and `fabric_reserved_range`
- Verify `NetworkACL.status.phase == "Ready"` and `Subnet.status.conditions[type=NetworkACLAssociationReady] == True` only after explicit manager activation acknowledgement
- Verify fabric job success or ConfigMap VNI data alone does not satisfy the ACL activation condition or make the Subnet READY
- Verify k8s job created with VNI in extra_vars
- Verify Subnet.status.phase transitions: Pending → Provisioning → Ready, with Ready reached only after associated policy is active
- Delete Subnet, verify finalizer blocks until fabric and k8s jobs complete

**fulfillment-service + osac-operator (Kind cluster, mocked fabric manager):**

- Create VirtualNetwork and a READY NetworkACL scoped to it; create first Subnet with an explicit reference to that ACL → succeeds
- With an active or in-progress VM placement on the first Subnet, create a second Subnet referencing the same ACL → API returns 400 FailedPrecondition
- Remove the VM, retry the second Subnet create with the same explicit ACL association → succeeds as fabric-only
- Race a second-Subnet create against VM placement from a one-Subnet, VM-free VirtualNetwork → exactly one topology admission succeeds; never admit both a VM and a multi-Subnet VirtualNetwork
- Race Subnet deletion against an in-progress VM placement before a VM object exists → deletion request persists a `Requested` reservation, blocks new placements and Subnet creates, and does not start cleanup until the placement completes
- Verify VM placement and additional Subnet creation remain blocked through both deletion reservation states, deprovisioning retries, and finalizer removal
- Attempt VM placement while the VirtualNetwork has multiple Subnets → VMaaS rejects placement
- Create a second VirtualNetwork and its READY NetworkACL, then create a Subnet explicitly associated with that ACL → succeeds (different VirtualNetwork)

**Fabric output ConfigMap data path validation (Kind cluster, real AAP):**

- Create a VirtualNetwork and READY same-VirtualNetwork NetworkACL, then
  create a Subnet with an explicit association.
- After fabric provisioning, inspect the output ConfigMap named by the fabric
  job target and verify `data.extra_vars` parses as JSON containing `l2_vni`,
  `l3_vni`, and `fabric_reserved_range`.
- Verify the provisioning package reads those values from the ConfigMap and
  passes them as `extra_vars` to the k8s manager job.
- Treat a missing or invalid ConfigMap value as `VNIExtractionFailed`; do not
  fall back to AAP Job CR `status.extraVars`.

### E2E Tests

**osac-test-infra (pytest, physical fabric managed by the configured fabric manager + OCP cluster):**

`tests/test_evpn_vm_to_fabric_connectivity.py`:

**Preconditions:**
- OCP cluster with OVN-Kubernetes, FRR operator, NMState operator installed
- VTEP CR exists (tenant-vtep)
- FRRConfiguration exists with underlay BGP peering (evpn: "true" label)
- RouteAdvertisements CR exists (frrConfigurationSelector matches FRRConfiguration)
- Configured fabric manager and physical fabric accessible, API credentials configured
- NetworkClass "primary-evpn" with fabric_manager="primary", k8s_manager="cudn_evpn"
- A fabric-only NetworkClass with a fabric manager and no k8s manager for the cross-Subnet bare-metal test

**Test A — VM and bare-metal same-Subnet L2 connectivity:**

1. Create Tenant via fulfillment-service API
2. Create VirtualNetwork with IPv4 CIDR 200.200.0.0/16, networkClass="primary-evpn"
3. Create a READY NetworkACL in that VirtualNetwork with rules permitting the test traffic in both directions
4. Create Subnet 200.200.1.0/24 with `spec.network_acl` explicitly referencing that same-VirtualNetwork ACL
5. Wait for the ACL policy to be active and for Subnet.status.phase == "Ready" (timeout 300s)
6. Verify CUDN exists on OCP: `kubectl get clusteruserdefinednetwork <vnet-name>`
7. Verify CUDN status.conditions Ready=True
8. Deploy a VirtualMachine in the CUDN namespace
9. Wait for VMI Running with IP in 200.200.1.0/24
10. Verify FRR VNI status: `vtysh -c "show evpn vni"` includes L2 VNI and L3 VNI
11. Verify BGP EVPN routes: `vtysh -c "show bgp l2vpn evpn"` includes Type-2 (MAC), Type-3 (VTEP), Type-5 (prefix)
12. Provision a bare-metal node on the managed fabric in the same Subnet (200.200.1.0/24)
13. Verify L2 connectivity: VM pings bare-metal node on the same Subnet
14. Delete the VM, then delete the Subnet; verify CUDN deletion
15. Verify the fabric manager VNet is deleted (API query)

**Test B — Fabric-only cross-Subnet L3 connectivity:**

1. Create a separate VirtualNetwork using the fabric-only NetworkClass; do not create any VMs in this VirtualNetwork
2. Create a READY NetworkACL scoped to this VirtualNetwork with rules permitting the test traffic in both directions
3. Create two Subnets with distinct CIDRs, each explicitly referencing that same-VirtualNetwork NetworkACL
4. Wait for the ACL policy to be active and for both Subnets to reach READY
5. Provision one bare-metal endpoint in each Subnet
6. Verify cross-Subnet L3 connectivity between the bare-metal endpoints via the fabric routing domain
7. Delete both Subnets, the NetworkACL, and the VirtualNetwork

**Expected Results:**

- VM receives IP from 200.200.1.0/24 range (OVN-K IPAM)
- VM MAC and IP advertised to fabric via BGP EVPN Type-2 route
- L2 ping succeeds (same-subnet VM ↔ bare-metal)
- Cross-Subnet L3 ping succeeds between bare-metal endpoints in the separate fabric-only VirtualNetwork; that VirtualNetwork has no VMs
- FRR shows VTEP 10.2.0.2 (ns-leaf-1) as remote VTEP for VNI
- Cleanup completes without orphaned resources

**Tricky Areas:**

- VNI extraction timing: fabric job may complete before controller reads status (race condition test)
- CUDN VNI collision: first-Subnet provisioning for distinct VirtualNetworks created concurrently (stress test)
- Gateway MAC mismatch detection: compare CUDN gateway MAC with fabric manager VNet gateway MAC
- Fabric output ConfigMap loss or malformed `data.extra_vars` must fail closed; it cannot be inferred from job completion

## Graduation Criteria

Graduation criteria will be defined when targeting a release. Expected stages:

- **Dev Preview (0.3):** Single-cluster EVPN bridging with manual prerequisites, documented installation guide, E2E test in CI
- **Tech Preview (0.4):** Multi-cluster support (OSAC-3667 Phase 2), gateway MAC auto-coordination, VTEP automation
- **GA (0.5+):** OVN Connectors (inter-subnet routing), OVN-K secondary CUDN support (multi-NIC VMs), production SLA

Success signals for GA:
- 3+ customer deployments in production
- <1% Subnet provisioning failure rate
- <5min mean time to provision Subnet (fabric + k8s jobs)

## Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

**Upgrade (0.2 → 0.3):**

This is a new API — no existing resources to migrate. Upgrade steps:

1. Upgrade osac-installer (adds ConfigMap k8s-manager-cudn-evpn, RBAC for CUDN CRDs)
2. Upgrade osac-aap (adds fabric_manager fabric manager role + cudn_evpn k8s manager role)
3. Upgrade osac-operator (adds sequential provisioning logic)
4. Upgrade fulfillment-service (adds second-Subnet-with-VMs and VM placement topology validation)
5. Complete installation prerequisites (VTEP, FRRConfiguration, RouteAdvertisements)
6. Create NetworkClass with fabric_manager="primary", k8s_manager="cudn_evpn"
7. Tenants create a READY NetworkACL per VirtualNetwork and explicitly associate each Subnet; fabric manager VNet + CUDN are then provisioned as applicable

**Downgrade (0.3 → 0.2):**

Downgrade requires deleting all Subnets using NetworkClass with k8s_manager="cudn_evpn":

1. List all VirtualNetworks with networkClass containing cudn_evpn
2. Delete all Subnets under those VirtualNetworks (cascades CUDN deletion)
3. Delete NetworkClass
4. Downgrade osac components (fulfillment-service, osac-operator, osac-aap, osac-installer)
5. CUDN CRDs remain on cluster (OVN-Kubernetes owns them, safe to leave)

**Backward Compatibility:**

- Existing NetworkClass with k8s_manager="cudn_localnet" or empty k8s_manager unaffected
- Existing Subnet reconciliation unchanged (no k8s manager → no sequential provisioning)
- New validation logic is additive (only applies to k8s_manager="cudn_evpn")

## Version Skew Strategy

**fulfillment-service vs osac-operator:**

- fulfillment-service 0.3 + osac-operator 0.2: Subnet API accepts requests, but operator ignores k8s_manager (parallel provisioning only). Subnets with k8s_manager="cudn_evpn" fail (no cudn_evpn role). **Mitigation:** Upgrade operator before fulfillment-service.
- fulfillment-service 0.2 + osac-operator 0.3: Subnet API has no second-Subnet-with-VMs validation. Operator supports sequential provisioning but never triggered (no k8s_manager set). Safe skew.

**Recommended upgrade order:** osac-aap → osac-operator → fulfillment-service → osac-installer

**CRD Version Migration:**

ClusterUserDefinedNetwork and FRRConfiguration are external CRDs (OVN-Kubernetes, FRR operator). OSAC does not manage their versions. If OVN-K upgrades CUDN from v1 to v1beta2, k8s manager playbook must update apiVersion. No automatic migration.

## Support Procedures

**Failure Detection:**

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnostic Command |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Subnet stuck in "Provisioning" >5min | Fabric job hanging or k8s job waiting for fabric | `kubectl get job -n osac \| grep <subnet-id>`, check AAP UI for job status |
| Subnet status "Failed" with "VNIExtractionFailed" event | Fabric job succeeded but set_stats missing VNI data | `kubectl logs -n osac <fabric-job-pod>`, check Ansible output for set_stats call |
| CUDN exists but VMs have no network | VTEP down, FRR not advertising routes | `oc get vtep tenant-vtep`, `oc exec -n openshift-frr-k8s <frr-pod> -- vtysh -c "show evpn vni"` |
| VM pings same-subnet bare-metal fail (L2) | VNI mismatch, gateway MAC mismatch | Compare CUDN macVRF.vni with fabric manager VNet vxlanID, compare gateway MACs |
| Bare-metal endpoints cannot reach across Subnets (L3) | ipVRF route target mismatch, fabric routing issue | `vtysh -c "show bgp l2vpn evpn" \| grep Type-5`, check fabric manager VPC routing table |
| Subnet delete completes but VRF device persists on worker node | Stale VRF not cleaned up by OVN after CUDN delete (rare race condition) | `oc debug node/<node-name> -- chroot /host ip link show type vrf` |

**Manual Recovery Procedures:**

**Stale VRF Cleanup (observed during testing, rare):**

If a VRF device persists on a worker node after CUDN deletion:

1. Identify the stale VRF:
   ```bash
   oc debug node/<node-name> -- chroot /host ip link show type vrf
   # Look for VRF named after the deleted VirtualNetwork
   ```

2. Verify CUDN is actually deleted:
   ```bash
   oc get clusteruserdefinednetwork <vnet-name>
   # Should return "NotFound"
   ```

3. **Manual cleanup (if VRF persists after CUDN gone):**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Restart ovnkube-node pod on affected node (impacts all VMs on node)
   oc delete pod -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes -l app=ovnkube-node --field-selector spec.nodeName=<node-name>

   # Option 2: Direct VRF deletion (less disruptive, requires node access)
   oc debug node/<node-name>
   chroot /host
   ip link delete <vrf-name> type vrf
   ```

**Impact:** Restarting ovnkube-node disrupts all VMs on the affected node (not just the deleted namespace). Only use when VRF persists after confirming CUDN is deleted.

**Prevention:** This is a timing race in OVN-Kubernetes. No known mitigation. If observed frequently, report to OVN-Kubernetes upstream.

**Disabling the Feature:**

1. Delete all VirtualNetworks using NetworkClass with k8s_manager="cudn_evpn"
2. Delete the NetworkClass
3. Delete ConfigMap k8s-manager-cudn-evpn (prevents new registrations)

**Consequences:**
- **Cluster health:** No impact (CUDN and FRRConfiguration remain, harmless)
- **Existing workloads:** VMs in CUDN namespaces continue running (CUDN lifecycle independent of OSAC after provisioning)
- **New workloads:** Tenants cannot create new Subnets with cudn_evpn (NetworkClass validation fails)

**Re-Enabling:**

Recreate ConfigMap and NetworkClass. Existing CUDNs remain orphaned (no owner-reference to Subnet). Consistency maintained: Subnet delete will not cascade to CUDN if CUDN created before re-enable.

## Infrastructure Needed

None. All infrastructure (OCP cluster, physical fabric managed by the configured fabric manager, FRR operator) is assumed to exist per PRD assumptions.
