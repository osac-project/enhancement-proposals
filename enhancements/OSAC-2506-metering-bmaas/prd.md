## Glossary

Terms defined in the [Part 1 PRD](/enhancements/OSAC-985-metering-and-usage-tracking/prd.md) apply here. Additional terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Allocation metering** | Metering that runs from provisioning complete until the host enters `FAILED` or is deleted, regardless of whether the resource is actively in use. Reflects the provider's physical capacity commitment. A `FAILED` host is not billable for any meter. |
| **BareMetalInstanceType** | A provider-defined OSAC resource that identifies a bare metal hardware configuration. A `BareMetalInstance` references it through `spec.instance_type`; the reference is the primary metering dimension for BMaaS. |

## 1. Problem Statement

OSAC provisions bare metal hosts but has no mechanism to track their consumption over time. The first metering PRD ([Part 1](/enhancements/OSAC-985-metering-and-usage-tracking/prd.md)) established metering for VMaaS, CaaS, and MaaS — all consumption-based meters where metering runs only while the resource is actively serving workloads. BMaaS is fundamentally different: bare metal hosts consume provider capacity from the moment they are provisioned until they enter `FAILED` or are deleted, regardless of whether the tenant is actively using them. A bare metal host is physically reserved and cannot be reassigned — the provider commits rack space, a power port, and a network port whether the host is powered on or off. A host in `FAILED` state is not billable for any meter.

Without metering for bare metal hosts, Cloud Provider Admins have no usage data to account for the hardware capacity tenants hold, and Tenant Admins have no visibility into the extent of their bare metal footprint across projects and BareMetalInstanceTypes.

## 2. In Scope

- BMaaS allocation metering — metering for bare metal hosts from provisioning complete until `FAILED` or deletion, regardless of power state (RUNNING, STOPPED, STARTING, STOPPING)
- BMaaS consumption metering — meter for powered-on time (RUNNING state only), enabling differentiated metering between active and stopped hosts
- Parent-child attribution — extending [Part 1](/enhancements/OSAC-985-metering-and-usage-tracking/prd.md) CAP-11 and CAP-12 so that storage volumes and public IPs attached to a bare metal host can be queried as a unified usage view

## 3. Out of Scope

- Storage metering (block, file, object storage) — tracked separately ([OSAC-3141](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-3141))
- Networking resource metering (VirtualNetworks, Subnets, PublicIPs, etc.) — tracked separately ([OSAC-3145](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-3145))
- Network bandwidth metering (ingress/egress traffic) — tracked separately ([OSAC-3149](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-3149))
- Costing, billing, quota enforcement, and budget alerts — deferred to a separate PRD
- VMaaS, CaaS, and MaaS metering — covered in [Part 1](/enhancements/OSAC-985-metering-and-usage-tracking/prd.md)
- UI for viewing BMaaS usage — metering data is consumed by the billing system, which provides the user-facing usage views
- Workload-level metering inside bare metal hosts

## 4. User Stories

### Cloud Provider Admin

- As a Cloud Provider Admin, I want to view aggregated bare metal host usage across all tenants for a given time period, broken down by tenant, BareMetalInstanceType, and catalog item (per Part 1 CAP-17), so that I can account for the physical hardware each tenant holds.
- As a Cloud Provider Admin, I want bare metal hosts to be metered from provisioning complete until `FAILED` or deletion regardless of power state, so that I can track the capacity commitment of physically reserved hardware even when the tenant has powered it off.
- As a Cloud Provider Admin, I want to see both allocation and consumption meters for bare metal hosts, so that I can distinguish between reserved capacity and active usage. A bare metal host occupies physical capacity (rack space, power port, network cable) whether powered on or off — the allocation meter captures this. When powered on, it additionally consumes electricity, cooling, and CPU cycles — the consumption meter captures this. The dual-meter model gives providers two independent usage signals per host, enabling downstream systems to distinguish reserved from active capacity.

### Cloud Infrastructure Admin

- Not directly affected by this feature. BMaaS metering uses BareMetalInstanceTypes already configured via OSAC-1201 — no separate registration step in the metering system is required.

### Tenant Admin

- As a Tenant Admin, I want to view my organization's bare metal host usage broken down by project and BareMetalInstanceType, so that I can attribute hardware usage to the teams that reserved the machines.
- As a Tenant Admin, I want to see the total usage footprint of a bare metal host including its attached storage volumes and public IPs, so that I can understand the full resource consumption of each machine without querying multiple reports.

### Tenant User

- Not directly affected by this feature. Bare metal hosts are typically provisioned and managed by Tenant Admins; Tenant Users interact with the workloads running on them.

## 5. Capabilities

### 5.1 BMaaS Allocation Metering

- **CAP-1:** Bare metal hosts are metered using allocation-based metering from provisioning complete until the host enters `FAILED` or is deleted, regardless of power state (RUNNING, STOPPED, STARTING, STOPPING). The allocation meter (`bare-metal-instance-type-seconds`) reflects the physical capacity reservation by the tenant; a host in `FAILED` state is not billable for any meter.
- **CAP-2:** A consumption meter (`bare-metal-compute-seconds`) runs while the host is in RUNNING state, enabling differentiated metering between active and stopped hosts.
- **CAP-3:** BMaaS usage is queryable by `bm_instance_type`, catalog item (per Part 1 CAP-17), tenant, and project. `bm_instance_type` is the primary metering dimension, analogous to `instance_type` for VMaaS.

### 5.2 Dual Metering Model

- **CAP-4:** Allocation-based and consumption-based meters coexist for the same resource. A bare metal host has both an allocation meter (host reserved) and a consumption meter (host powered on). Usage queries can distinguish between these meter types.

### 5.3 Cross-cutting

- **CAP-5:** Allocation-meter and consumption-meter data is available alongside existing metering data without additional admin configuration steps. All BMaaS meters use the same accuracy and data-availability guarantees as Part 1 meters (Part 1 CAP-4, Part 1 CAP-15, Part 1 CAP-16).

## 6. Usage Calculation Model

OSAC captures usage data. Downstream systems (billing, quota, analytics) consume this data and apply their own logic. This section defines the metering units and accumulation rules for BMaaS, extending the usage calculation model from [Part 1](/enhancements/OSAC-985-metering-and-usage-tracking/prd.md).

BMaaS uses two meters because bare metal hosts have a dual capacity profile. The **allocation meter** runs continuously until `FAILED` because the physical host is reserved for the tenant and cannot be reassigned — it occupies rack space, a power port, and a network port regardless of power state. The **consumption meter** runs only while the host is powered on, capturing active compute usage separately from the baseline reservation. Neither meter accrues usage while the host is in `FAILED` state.

| Meter | Scope | Unit | Accumulation | Example (24 hours) |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| bare-metal-instance-type-seconds (allocation) | provisioning complete until `FAILED` or deletion | seconds | wall-clock duration the host is allocation-billable | 86,400s |
| bare-metal-compute-seconds (consumption) | RUNNING only | seconds | wall-clock duration the host is powered on | 43,200s (if running 12 of 24 hours) |

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A bare metal host generates allocation usage data (`bare-metal-instance-type-seconds`) from provisioning complete until `FAILED` or deletion, queryable per tenant and `bm_instance_type`
- [ ] A bare metal host in STOPPED state continues generating allocation usage data
- [ ] A bare metal host in `FAILED` state generates no allocation or consumption usage data
- [ ] A bare metal host in RUNNING state generates consumption usage data (bare-metal-compute-seconds)
- [ ] BMaaS usage can be broken down by `bm_instance_type`, catalog item (per Part 1 CAP-17), tenant, and project
- [ ] A bare metal host with attached storage volumes and public IPs can be queried as a unified usage view
- [ ] Allocation-based and consumption-based meters coexist for the same resource; usage queries can distinguish between meter types
- [ ] Allocation-meter and consumption-meter data is accessible through the same metering query APIs as existing VMaaS/CaaS meters without additional admin setup
- [ ] BMaaS meters record usage at per-second granularity — a host existing for 30 seconds appears in usage data
- [ ] BMaaS usage totals for finalized periods (deleted hosts) are accurate — querying the same period twice returns consistent results
- [ ] Historical BMaaS usage data is available for at least 13 months
- [ ] Enabling BMaaS metering does not disrupt existing provisioning workflows

## 8. Assumptions

- Part 1 metering infrastructure is deployed and operational.
- BMaaS meters are additive to the Part 1 metering deployment and require no separate infrastructure.
- Bare metal hosts will have a non-empty, immutable `spec.instance_type` reference before BMaaS metering is implemented. OSAC-1201 (BareMetalInstanceType) is the vehicle for this.
- Allocation-based metering is supported by the Part 1 metering infrastructure without architectural changes.
- Bare metal hosts used as CaaS cluster nodes generate BMaaS usage data independently of CaaS metering. Both meters capture distinct usage dimensions (hardware reservation vs. managed service). Deduplication or bundling is a downstream billing concern.

## 9. Dependencies

- **Part 1 metering infrastructure:** The metering infrastructure established by [Part 1](/enhancements/OSAC-985-metering-and-usage-tracking/prd.md) is a prerequisite. Part 2a extends but does not replace it.
- **OSAC-1201 (BareMetalInstanceType):** Must define BareMetalInstanceTypes and populate `BareMetalInstance.spec.instance_type`. Without this reference, BMaaS metering has no primary metering dimension. See the [BareMetalInstanceType EP](https://github.com/osac-project/enhancement-proposals/pull/119) (OSAC-2675) for the design.

## 10. Risks

### 10.1 BMaaS metering dimension not yet in proto

- **Owner:** OSAC platform team
- **Mitigation:** OSAC-1201 (BareMetalInstanceType) must define the resource and populate `BareMetalInstance.spec.instance_type`. Until that reference is available, BMaaS metering has no primary metering dimension and cannot be implemented. Track OSAC-1201 as a blocking dependency.

### 10.2 Part 1 metering infrastructure not yet built

- **Owner:** OSAC platform team
- **Mitigation:** All Part 2a meters depend on the metering infrastructure established by Part 1 (OSAC-985). Part 2a implementation cannot begin until Part 1 infrastructure is deployed. The Part 1 design is complete; implementation has not started.
