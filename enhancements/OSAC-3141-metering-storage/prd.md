## Problem Statement

OSAC provisions block storage volumes but has no mechanism to track their consumption over time. Block volumes consume provider capacity from the moment they are created until they are deleted, regardless of whether they are actively in use — a block volume occupies backend disk space whether the parent VM is running or not. A block volume's actual backend footprint is opaque to tenants — thin provisioning, compression, deduplication, and snapshots make physical consumption variable and unpredictable. The tenant's only actionable number is the logical capacity they provisioned.

Without metering for block storage, Cloud Provider Admins have no usage data to account for the storage capacity tenants hold, and Tenant Admins have no visibility into their block-storage footprint across projects and storage tiers. This gap grows as OSAC adds new storage types — every new storage resource added without metering is usage the provider cannot track.

## In Scope

- Block storage metering — allocation-based metering for standalone Volumes (OSAC-984) by storage tier and capacity (GiB-seconds), regardless of what the volume is attached to (including volumes attached to bare metal hosts)
- Applies across VMaaS (block volumes on ComputeInstances) and CaaS (volumes on ClusterOrders); the volume meter also covers volumes attached to bare metal hosts, whose unified host footprint view is owned by OSAC-2506
- Volume expansion through the existing dimension-update event path, with usage split at the committed effective timestamp

## Out of Scope

- File storage metering — tracked separately ([OSAC-4940](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-4940))
- Object storage metering — tracked separately ([OSAC-3444](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-3444))
- Bare metal host resource metering (host-time, CPU, memory) and the unified bare-metal-host footprint view that rolls attached volumes into a host's usage — tracked separately ([OSAC-2506](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-2506)). OSAC-3141 still produces the block-volume meter for those volumes; OSAC-2506 attributes them to the host.
- Networking resource metering — tracked separately ([OSAC-3145](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-3145))
- Network bandwidth metering — tracked separately ([OSAC-3149](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-3149))
- Costing, billing, quota enforcement, and budget alerts — deferred to a separate PRD
- Parent-child attribution for attached Volumes — tracked as a follow-up with OSAC-4884
- VM boot disk storage tier attribution — tracked separately
- OSAC UI views for storage usage — downstream billing and usage systems provide presentation of the metering data
- Workload-level metering inside tenant environments

## User Stories

### Cloud Provider Admin

- As a Cloud Provider Admin, I want to access block storage usage across all tenants broken down by the storage tiers configured in OSAC (e.g., fast, standard, archival) and capacity, so that I can account for the block-storage capacity each tenant holds by tier without separately registering each tier in the metering system.

### Tenant Admin

- As a Tenant Admin, I want to access my organization's block storage usage broken down by project, storage tier, and volume, so that I can identify which teams consume the most storage capacity and on which tier.

### Tenant User

- As a Tenant User, I want to access block storage usage for the projects I belong to, broken down by volume and storage tier, so that I can track how much storage capacity my workloads consume and on which tier.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A block storage volume generates usage data (GiB-seconds) for the period it holds allocated capacity — from when it becomes available for use until it enters `FAILED` or the platform records the deletion request, whichever comes first — queryable per tenant, storage tier, and capacity
- [ ] A block storage volume that fails to provision and never becomes available generates no usage data
- [ ] Storage usage can be broken down by storage tier, tenant, project, and individual volume
- [ ] A block storage volume attached to a stopped VM continues generating usage data
- [ ] Storage usage data appears alongside existing metering data without additional admin setup
- [ ] Storage meters record usage at per-second granularity — a volume existing for 30 seconds appears in usage data
- [ ] Storage usage totals are accurate — querying the same period twice returns consistent results
- [ ] A successful volume expansion emits the committed new capacity and effective timestamp, and metering reports the old and new capacity intervals separately; failed or reverted expansions do not change usage
- [ ] Raw storage metering events are retained for at least 7 days (configurable), per Part 1 metering requirements
- [ ] Aggregated storage usage data is retained for at least 13 months (configurable), per Part 1 metering requirements
- [ ] Enabling storage metering does not disrupt existing provisioning workflows

## Assumptions

- Part 1 metering infrastructure is deployed and operational.
- Storage metering is added to the existing Part 1 metering service without requiring separate tenant or administrator setup.
- The tenant-facing block storage Volume API will be implemented before block storage metering.
- The Part 1 metering service supports allocation-based metering for block storage.
- Storage usage closes at the earlier of a terminal `FAILED` transition and the platform's durable deletion-request timestamp. Vendor cleanup may continue after that boundary and is not included in the initial usage interval.

## Dependencies

- **Part 1 metering infrastructure:** The metering infrastructure established by [Part 1](/enhancements/OSAC-985-metering-and-usage-tracking/prd.md) is a prerequisite. Block storage metering extends but does not replace it.
- **OSAC-984 (Storage Volume API):** A tenant-facing block storage Volume resource must exist before block storage metering can be implemented. Parent attribution remains a follow-up capability; resize uses the Volume API's dimension-update event path.
