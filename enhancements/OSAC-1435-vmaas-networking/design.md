# VMaaS Networking — Optional Attachments and Auto External Access

This enhancement extends the unified networking API to support VMaaS-specific requirements: a single ComputeInstance network attachment with an implicit primary/default route, optional network attachments with tenant defaults, and auto-provisioned external access (ExternalIP). The repeated attachment field is retained for API compatibility and is validated to contain at most one entry.

## Summary

This enhancement is an expansion of the [Unified Networking EP](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md), providing the detailed per-service flow for this service type. The unified EP defines the shared architecture (NetworkClass, dispatcher, infrastructure-agnostic subnets, resource hierarchy); this document defines how this specific service consumes that architecture.

VMaaS inherits the [Unified Networking deployment support
boundary](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#deployment-support-boundary):
VM networking supports connected deployments only and does not add air-gapped
or disconnected networking support.

VMaaS networking also inherits the [Unified Networking hub support
boundary](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#networking-hub-support-boundary):
OSAC networking supports exactly one provider-owned hub per deployment.
Multi-hub networking placement, cross-hub resource coordination, and
cross-hub network connectivity are unsupported. This boundary applies only to
the networking area and does not define hub behavior for other OSAC areas.
Multiple hosting/workload clusters remain supported where a networking feature
explicitly specifies them.

ComputeInstance currently uses a `ComputeNetworkAttachment` message. This enhancement keeps the existing repeated attachment field optional (populating it with tenant defaults when omitted), enforces a maximum of one entry, and adds `auto_external_ip_attachment` to enable fully connected VMs in a single API call. VMaaS has no primary field: the sole attachment is implicitly the default route. See [PRD](prd.md) for detailed requirements.

The manager-backed resource flows and provider IP-discovery/readiness behavior
in this document describe the enabled mode. The feature-gated disabled behavior
is specified at the end of the Proposal section. API-level SecurityGroup rule
validation and reference checks remain active in disabled mode. OSAC submits no
provider operation to apply or remove SecurityGroup rules; rules already
programmed in the backend may continue to affect traffic until provider-side
cleanup. [User]

## Motivation

ComputeInstance already participates in the networking API. Today's flow:

1. Tenant creates VirtualNetwork, Subnet, SecurityGroup via API
2. osac-operator's networking controllers reconcile each resource as a standalone AAP job, using `implementation_strategy` to select the Ansible role (e.g., `osac.templates.cudn_net.create_subnet`)
3. Tenant creates ComputeInstance with `network_attachments` (`ComputeNetworkAttachment`, no `primary` field, single-NIC only)
4. osac-operator's ComputeInstance controller resolves subnet → namespace, triggers AAP job
5. AAP template (`osac.templates.ocp_virt_vm`) creates KubeVirt VirtualMachine with one `l2bridge` interface in the subnet's CUDN namespace

### What Already Works

- `network_attachments` field exists on ComputeInstanceSpec (field 14)
- Operator CRD has `NetworkAttachments []ComputeNetworkAttachment` with CEL cardinality and immutability rules; the complete resolved attachment is immutable
- Subnet-to-namespace resolution is implemented
- The template creates VMs in the correct namespace
- ExternalIPAttachment with `compute_instance` target works end-to-end

### What's Missing

- Existing `ComputeNetworkAttachment` has no `primary` field; the compatibility field remains single-attachment only
- Service-level maximum-one validation and field-level defaulting are still required
- At most one attachment — template creates one `l2bridge` interface
- No dispatcher — uses `implementation_strategy` annotation
- BM-only deployment validation (reject VM when no k8sManager)
- Auto ExternalIP allocation (tenant must manually create ExternalIP + ExternalIPAttachment)

### Goals

- Single-NIC support with an implicit primary attachment for the default gateway
- Resource-specific attachment message (`ComputeNetworkAttachment`); the sole attachment is implicitly primary
- Optional `network_attachments` field — populate with tenant defaults when omitted
- Auto ExternalIP attachment (`auto_external_ip_attachment`) for single-call inbound connectivity
- BM-only deployment validation to reject VM provisioning when no k8s_manager is available

### Non-Goals

- CaaS or BMaaS networking (this EP covers VMaaS only)
- Dispatcher infrastructure implementation (deferred to Unified Networking EP implementation)
- Kubernetes manager implementation (CUDN or EVPN fabric integration via k8s_manager roles)

## Proposal

### Workflow Description

#### Networking Setup (unchanged pattern, new dispatch mechanism)

1. **Tenant creates VirtualNetwork:**
   ```bash
   osac create virtualnetwork --network-class moc-bm-virt --cidr 10.0.0.0/16 --name my-net
   ```
   - fulfillment-service → creates VirtualNetwork CR
   - osac-operator VirtualNetwork controller → dispatcher resolves NetworkClass → calls `osac.templates.{{ fabric_manager }}.create_virtual_network`
   - Fabric manager creates isolated tenant segment on the fabric

2. **Tenant creates Subnet:**
   ```bash
   osac create subnet --virtual-network my-net --cidr 10.0.1.0/24 --name my-subnet
   ```
   - osac-operator Subnet controller → dispatcher resolves NetworkClass → triggers TWO AAP jobs (multi-job tracking per OSAC-1459):
     - `osac.templates.{{ fabric_manager }}.create_subnet` — creates VLAN / fabric segment
     - `osac.templates.{{ k8s_manager }}.create_subnet` — creates CUDN overlay on each hosting cluster, bridges to the fabric segment
   - After both complete: subnet is Ready. The CUDN namespace is the deployment target for VMs.

3. **Tenant creates SecurityGroup:**
   ```bash
   osac create security-group --virtual-network my-net --name my-sg \
     --ingress "protocol:tcp,port:443,source:0.0.0.0/0"
   ```
   - Dispatcher → `osac.templates.{{ fabric_manager }}.create_security_group`
   - Fabric manager creates ACL rules on the fabric

#### VM Creation

4. **Tenant creates ComputeInstance:**
   ```bash
   # Explicit networking:
   osac create computeinstance --template ocp_virt_vm \
     --network-attachment subnet=my-subnet,security-groups=my-sg \
     --name my-vm

   # Or with defaults + auto external access:
   osac create computeinstance --template ocp_virt_vm \
     --external-ip-attachment --name my-vm
   ```
   - fulfillment-service:
     - If `network_attachments` is omitted or empty: populates the sole attachment with the tenant's default Subnet and default SecurityGroup (see Default Networking PRD)
     - If one attachment is supplied, defaults only missing fields: a missing Subnet receives the tenant default Subnet, and a missing or empty SecurityGroup list receives the tenant default SecurityGroup only when the resolved Subnet belongs to the tenant's default VirtualNetwork; otherwise the caller must provide SecurityGroups from the resolved Subnet's VirtualNetwork; supplied values are preserved
     - Validates: at most one attachment; the subnet is Ready and the security groups belong to the same VN
     - If `auto_external_ip_attachment == true`: auto-selects ExternalIPPool (READY, most available capacity), creates ExternalIP in the same DB transaction as the ComputeInstance — ExternalIP starts in **Pending** state. Pool capacity is decremented atomically; if the pool is exhausted, the API call fails and no resources are persisted. ExternalIPAttachment is **not** created at this point — it is deferred to the fulfillment-service internal reconciler, which creates it only after the ExternalIP is Allocated and the ComputeInstance is Ready. See [Unified Networking — Auto-provisioning lifecycle](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#auto-provisioning-lifecycle-auto_external_ip_attachment) for the full stepped flow.
   - Creates ComputeInstance CR with `network_attachments`

5. **osac-operator ComputeInstance controller:**

   a. `resolveNetworking` (existing logic, extended):
      - `PrimarySubnetRef()` → returns the sole attachment's subnet
      - `resolveSubnetTargetNamespace()` → looks up Subnet CR → namespace (same as today)
      - Stamps `osac.openshift.io/subnet-target-namespace` annotation
      - **No dispatcher call for network attachments** — VMs don't need switch port configuration. The k8sManager's work was done at subnet creation (step 2). The overlay already exists.

   b. Triggers AAP job: `osac-create-compute-instance`

6. **AAP template (`osac.templates.ocp_virt_vm`):**
   - Reads `subnet-target-namespace` → deployment namespace
   - Reads `network_attachments`:
     - With one attachment: creates VM with one `l2bridge` interface in the subnet's CUDN namespace. That attachment gets the default gateway.
   - Reads `securityGroupRefs` → adds as pod labels
   - Creates DataVolume + KubeVirt VirtualMachine
   - VM gets IP from each CUDN (via DHCP)
   - VM is on the fabric (overlay bridged at subnet creation)
   - **No networking logic** — template does OS/VM provisioning only. VMs join the fabric through the overlay, not through switch ports.

#### IP Discovery (feedback loop)

7. **osac-operator ComputeInstance feedback controller** discovers VM IPs:
   - Watches KubeVirt VMI (VirtualMachineInstance) network status
   - Reads the assigned IP from the VM's sole `vmi.status.interfaces[].ipAddress`
   - Maps the interface to the corresponding `compute_network_attachment` by CUDN NAD reference
   - Fires Signal RPC to fulfillment-service with per-attachment IP data
   - fulfillment-service writes `compute_network_attachment_statuses` on ComputeInstanceStatus (each entry: `subnet_ref`, `ip_address`)
   - Tenant can inspect: `osac get computeinstance my-vm -o yaml` shows the assigned IP for the attachment

#### External Access (optional, auto-provisioned when `auto_external_ip_attachment=true`)

8. **ExternalIP reconciliation:**
   - ExternalIP (created at step 4) is pushed to the hub cluster by the fulfillment-service reconciler
   - osac-operator dispatches `external_ip.allocate` to the manager selected by the NetworkClass profile. The manager writes its durable UID-owned address reservation to the ExternalIP annotation; OSAC validates the job result and annotation, writes status, and transitions the ExternalIP to **Allocated**. See [Unified Networking — ExternalIP Address Selection and Ownership](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#externalip-address-selection-and-ownership).
   - ExternalIP labeled `osac.openshift.io/auto-created: "true"` and `osac.openshift.io/auto-created-for: <compute-instance-id>`

9. **Deferred ExternalIPAttachment creation (fulfillment-service internal reconciler):**
   - Once ExternalIP is **Allocated** AND ComputeInstance is **Ready** (with `compute_network_attachment_statuses` populated): fulfillment-service internal reconciler creates ExternalIPAttachment, labeled `osac.openshift.io/auto-created: "true"`
   - This follows the standard creation readiness gate — no exceptions
   - osac-operator ExternalIPAttachment controller dispatches to AAP → fabric manager creates DNAT rule: external IP → VM's primary subnet IP (from `compute_network_attachment_statuses`)
   - ExternalIPAttachment transitions to **Ready**

#### Deletion (reverse order)

9. **Delete ComputeInstance:**
   - **Auto-provisioned cleanup:** If ExternalIP/ExternalIPAttachment were created by the system (`auto_external_ip_attachment=true`, labeled `osac.openshift.io/auto-created: "true"`): parent finalizer deletes ExternalIPAttachment first, then ExternalIP.
   - **Manually created ExternalIPAttachments block deletion** — if the tenant created ExternalIPAttachments explicitly (not labeled `osac.openshift.io/auto-created`), the delete request is rejected. The tenant must remove them first. See [Unified Networking — Deletion Dependency Guards](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#deletion-dependency-guards).
   - **Default networking resources (VN, Subnet, SG, NATGateway) are NOT cleaned up** — they are tenant-scoped and shared across resources.
   - osac-operator triggers `osac-delete-compute-instance` AAP job
   - Template deletes KubeVirt VM + DataVolume
   - No `move_network_attachment` call — the VM lives on the CUDN overlay, not a fabric switch port, so it is never parked or port-moved (the port-move primitive and parking apply only to fabric-attached BM servers and CaaS agents)

10. **Delete networking resources:**
    - Each networking resource controller triggers its delete AAP job
    - Dispatcher calls the appropriate manager role for each

### API Extensions

#### Proto (fulfillment-service)

Use the existing `ComputeNetworkAttachment` field with a single-entry limit:

```protobuf
message ComputeNetworkAttachment {
  SubnetLocalReference subnet = 1;                         // Optional on input; immutable after resolution
  repeated SecurityGroupLocalReference security_groups = 2; // Optional on input; immutable after resolution
}

message ComputeInstanceSpec {
  // ... existing fields ...
  repeated ComputeNetworkAttachment network_attachments = 14; // optional; max 1
  optional bool auto_external_ip_attachment = 18;  // auto-provision ExternalIP + ExternalIPAttachment
}

message ComputeNetworkAttachmentStatus {
  string subnet_ref = 1;               // Subnet ID (echoed from spec)
  string ip_address = 2;               // Discovered from KubeVirt VMI network status after DHCP/overlay assignment
}

message ComputeInstanceStatus {
  // ... existing fields ...
  repeated ComputeNetworkAttachmentStatus compute_network_attachment_statuses = N; // NEW
}
```

#### Operator CRD (osac-operator)

Update `ComputeInstanceSpec.NetworkAttachments` struct:
- Add validation that the repeated field contains at most one attachment
- `PrimarySubnetRef()` returns the sole attachment (or no subnet when the list is empty)

CEL validation rule:
```yaml
- rule: "self.networkAttachments.size() <= 1"
  message: "at most one network attachment is supported"
```

Add `ComputeNetworkAttachmentStatus` to `ComputeInstanceStatus`:

```go
type ComputeInstanceStatus struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    ComputeNetworkAttachmentStatuses []ComputeNetworkAttachmentStatus `json:"computeNetworkAttachmentStatuses,omitempty"`
}

type ComputeNetworkAttachmentStatus struct {
    SubnetRef string `json:"subnetRef"`
    IPAddress string `json:"ipAddress,omitempty"` // Discovered from KubeVirt VMI after DHCP/overlay assignment
}
```

The feedback controller populates `ComputeNetworkAttachmentStatuses` by watching the KubeVirt VMI `status.interfaces` and mapping each interface IP to the corresponding attachment by CUDN NAD reference.

#### Server Validation (fulfillment-service)

- Validate that `network_attachments` contains at most one entry.
- Primary/default-route resolution: the sole attachment is implicitly primary; VMaaS has no primary field
- BM-only deployment check: if the NetworkClass has no k8sManager, reject ComputeInstance creation

#### Template Changes (osac-aap)

- `osac.templates.ocp_virt_vm/tasks/create_build_spec.yaml`: create one KubeVirt network/interface definition from `network_attachments`
- The attachment maps to a KubeVirt interface with `l2bridge` binding referencing the subnet's CUDN NAD
- The sole attachment receives IP + default gateway + DNS via DHCP

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

#### Component Responsibility

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------|
| fulfillment-service | Validate network_attachments, create CR, auto-provision ExternalIP, write `compute_network_attachment_statuses` from feedback |
| osac-operator ComputeInstance controller | Resolve subnet → namespace, trigger AAP, clean up auto-provisioned resources |
| osac-operator ComputeInstance feedback controller | Watch KubeVirt VMI network status, discover per-attachment IPs, Signal fulfillment-service |
| osac-operator networking controllers | Dispatch to managers via dispatcher (VN, Subnet, SG, ExternalIP) |
| AAP template (ocp_virt_vm) | Create single-NIC KubeVirt VM in correct namespace |
| fabric_manager (Ansible role) | VN/Subnet/SG/ExternalIP provisioning; no per-VM call |
| k8s_manager (Ansible role) | Create CUDN overlay at subnet creation; no per-VM call |

#### Primary Attachment Resolution

- The sole attachment is implicitly primary/default route
- More than one attachment is rejected

#### Auto-Provisioned Resource Lifecycle

- ExternalIP created at workload creation time (pool is Ready, creation readiness gate satisfied). ExternalIPAttachment created later by fulfillment-service internal reconciler (after ExternalIP Allocated + ComputeInstance Ready)
- Labeled `osac.openshift.io/auto-created: "true"`
- Parent resource finalizer deletes in order: ExternalIPAttachment → ExternalIP
- On permanent cleanup failure: finalizer removed, parent deleted, orphaned resources left for manual cleanup

#### Backward Compatibility Strategy

The existing repeated `network_attachments` field is retained unchanged for API
compatibility. The server and operator validate that it contains at most one
entry; omitted and empty lists invoke default resolution, while a supplied
single entry receives defaults only for missing fields. No new singular field or
dual-field migration is required. The sole VM attachment is implicitly
primary/default, and changing any resolved attachment field requires deleting
and recreating the VM.

### Security Considerations

This feature inherits the existing security model:
- Tenant isolation via `osac.openshift.io/tenant` annotation enforced by OPA policies
- Auto-provisioned resources (ExternalIP, ExternalIPAttachment) inherit tenant annotation from parent ComputeInstance
- No new authentication or authorization changes
- SecurityGroup rules control VM inbound traffic (tenant-configurable via explicit SG or default SG)
- The sole VM attachment uses the same SecurityGroup enforcement as the rest of the fabric

### Failure Handling and Recovery

#### ComputeInstance Controller Reconciliation Failures

- Subnet resolution failure (subnet not found, not Ready): the API rejects the create request with a `FailedPrecondition` error; the ComputeInstance is never created. See [Unified Networking — Creation Readiness Gates](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#creation-readiness-gates)
- Namespace resolution failure (subnet has no target namespace): ComputeInstance enters Failed state, retries after manual correction
- AAP job failure (template execution error): ComputeInstance enters Failed state with AAP job ID in status, manual investigation required

#### Auto ExternalIP Allocation Failures

- Pool exhaustion: create API call returns error, no resources persisted (pool capacity checked synchronously during the API call — see [auto-provisioning lifecycle](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#auto-provisioning-lifecycle-auto_external_ip_attachment))
- ExternalIP provisioning failure: ExternalIP enters Failed state, ComputeInstance remains in Pending (external access unavailable, VM may still function without inbound connectivity)
- ExternalIPAttachment provisioning failure: DNAT rule not created, inbound traffic does not reach VM (VM functional, external access unavailable)

#### Cleanup Failures

- Auto-provisioned resource cleanup transient failure: finalizer retries
- Auto-provisioned resource cleanup permanent failure: after N retries, finalizer is removed, parent resource deleted, orphaned ExternalIP/ExternalIPAttachment left in cluster (manual cleanup required)

### RBAC / Tenancy

No RBAC or tenancy changes. All new resources (ComputeInstance with its existing fields, auto-provisioned ExternalIP/ExternalIPAttachment) inherit tenant isolation from parent:
- `osac.openshift.io/tenant` annotation propagated from ComputeInstance to auto-created resources
- OPA policies enforce tenant-scoped operations according to each resource API;
  networking resources use create/list/get/delete and do not expose
  update/patch, while supported non-network workload updates remain available
- Tenant User can view and manage auto-provisioned resources (labeled `osac.openshift.io/auto-created: "true"`) via standard API

### Observability and Monitoring

New structured log events:
- ComputeInstance controller: `ResolvedPrimarySubnet` (info), `SubnetResolutionFailed` (error), `MultiNICProvisioning` (info)
- fulfillment-service: `AutoProvisionedExternalIP` (info), `ExternalIPPoolExhausted` (error)

New Kubernetes events on ComputeInstance:
- `NetworkingResolved`: subnet → namespace resolution succeeded
- `NetworkingResolutionFailed`: subnet resolution failed (not found, not Ready, BM-only deployment)
- `AutoExternalIPCreated`: ExternalIP and ExternalIPAttachment auto-provisioned

No new metrics or alerts (existing provisioning duration and failure rate metrics apply).

### Risks and Mitigations

#### Risk: k8s_manager implementation blocked or delayed

**Impact:** OSAC-1511 (CUDN) and OSAC-1717 (EVPN) are both in spike/blocked state. Without a k8s_manager, the Subnet controller cannot provision overlay networks, and VMaaS networking does not function.

**Mitigation:** Prioritize unblocking one of these dependencies. Accept that VMaaS remains unavailable until a k8s_manager exists. Document as a hard dependency.

**Reviewed by:** Engineering / Product

#### Risk: Multi-job tracking not implemented

**Impact:** OSAC-1459 is a prerequisite for Subnet controller to call both fabric_manager and k8s_manager. Without it, Subnet controller can only call one manager.

**Mitigation:** Defer multi-manager support or accept single-manager-only subnet provisioning. Document limitation.

**Reviewed by:** osac-operator team

#### Risk: ExternalIPPool exhaustion

**Impact:** Auto ExternalIP allocation fails, create API call returns error, tenant cannot create VM with `auto_external_ip_attachment=true`.

**Mitigation:** Pool capacity visible in status; clear error directs tenant to explicit allocation from another pool or contact admin.

**Reviewed by:** Cloud Provider Admin

### Drawbacks

#### Single-attachment compatibility constraint

The repeated `network_attachments` field remains in place to avoid an API
shape change. New requests containing more than one entry are rejected by
validation.

### Provider Networking Disabled

This service follows the shared provider-networking setting and disabled-mode
contract in [Unified Networking](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#provider-networking-control).
The setting is changed during installation or upgrade and takes effect after
the coordinated rollout. Networking APIs, authorization, validation and
defaulting, and ordinary service provisioning remain available while provider
networking is disabled.
[PRD: FR-8] [User]

1. Tenant attachment defaulting, authorization, reference validation, and
   readiness checks remain unchanged. An API-valid VM continues provisioning
   on the platform default network while provider networking is disabled. No
   tenant subnet placement, tenant SecurityGroup enforcement, or public routing
   is claimed in this mode. Omitted or empty API attachments continue to receive
   the existing tenant defaults, and invalid or non-ready references continue
   to be rejected. Supplied attachment values remain stored and validated, but
   do not cause provider networking to run while disabled. [User]

2. Real VMI addresses may still be discovered through platform feedback, but
   they do not attest to tenant Subnet provisioning or ExternalIP allocation.
   No tenant policy, provider routing, or public ExternalIP routing is created.
3. VM provisioning and deletion remain available. Network resource lifecycle
   follows the shared status and deletion contract, including auto-created
   children. Ordinary VM provisioning does not wait for an unallocated
   ExternalIP.

Each non-allocating Networking API resource follows the unified status
contract: after its logical preconditions pass, it reports `Ready=True` with
reason `ProvisioningDisabled` and a skipped-work message. Dependency checks
continue to use their existing API gates. An ExternalIPAttachment requires the
referenced ExternalIP to have `state=Allocated` and its target to be `Ready`. A
backend-confirmed ExternalIP may remain `Allocated` while it reports
`Ready=False`/`ProvisioningDisabled`; it still satisfies that allocated-state
gate, but its last-known address does not imply provider reachability. Resources
with unmet prerequisites remain in their normal waiting state, and create
requests retain their existing API precondition errors. An ExternalIP without a
confirmed allocation is `Pending`/`Progressing`, has an empty
address, and reports `Ready=False`/`ProvisioningDisabled`. A confirmed real
allocation retains its real address, confirmed through the manager-written
annotation, and `Allocated` state, but
reports `Progressing` and `Ready=False`/`ProvisioningDisabled` while disabled;
the address is last-known only. The full allocation and migration contract is
defined in [Unified Networking](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#resource-operation-behavior).
ComputeInstance Ready and platform-reported VMI addresses describe workload
provisioning and platform feedback only; they do not imply tenant-network
placement or routing.

Default SecurityGroup selection, rule validation, API readiness,
interface/cardinality/immutability, and deletion guards remain in force.
Disabled mode submits no provider operation to create, change, or remove
SecurityGroup rules; rules already programmed in the backend may continue to
affect traffic until provider-side cleanup. Automatic ExternalIP requests
retain existing pool/capacity checks;
an IP that stays unallocated exposes no fabricated address and does not satisfy
the Allocated prerequisite. An automatic ExternalIPAttachment is created only after the ExternalIP is
Allocated and the workload is Ready. Creating the Pending ExternalIP reserves one
pool-capacity slot until the logical ExternalIP is deleted; this is not a
provider allocation. With networking disabled the VM still provisions, the
ExternalIP stays Pending, and no ExternalIPAttachment object is created.
Deleting an ExternalIP while disabled releases its OSAC capacity slot without a
provider release operation; any earlier provider reservation may require
manual cleanup. See the shared
[ExternalIP disabled-mode contract](/enhancements/OSAC-1433-unified-networking/design.md#provider-networking-control).
[User]

## Alternatives (Not Implemented)

### Alternative 1: Single shared NetworkAttachment message with optional primary field

Instead of creating `ComputeNetworkAttachment`, extend the shared `NetworkAttachment` message with an optional `primary` field usable by all resource types.

**Rejected because:** Other resource types (Cluster, BaremetalInstance) have different attachment semantics. Resource-specific attachment messages provide cleaner API surface and type-specific validation; all current workload types enforce a single tenant attachment.

### Alternative 2: Capacity exhaustion creates Failed resource instead of returning error

Instead of returning an error when ExternalIPPool has no capacity, create a Failed ComputeInstance with a status condition.

**Rejected because:** Pool capacity is validated synchronously during the API call — if the pool is exhausted, the call fails atomically and no resources are persisted. Creating a Failed resource adds cleanup burden and audit trail complexity. Clear API error with no persisted state is simpler.

## Open Questions

### ~~1. Should capacity exhaustion return an API error or create a Failed resource?~~ — Resolved

Resolved: Return error, no resource persisted. Pool capacity checked synchronously. No Failed resource.

## Test Plan

### Provider Networking Control (FR-8)

- Verify normal VM provision/delete jobs still run with the shared setting
  disabled and sufficient baseline connectivity; no network provider job runs.
- Verify active network jobs are cancelled and awaited before skipped status
  or network-finalizer release, including deletion and retryable AAP failures.
- Verify non-allocating Networking API resources report `Ready=True`, reason
  `ProvisioningDisabled`, with a skipped-work message after logical
  preconditions pass; ExternalIP status distinguishes unconfirmed from
  confirmed real allocation and never exposes a placeholder. Enabled mode
  retains normal provider behavior.
- Verify invalid API/defaulting/dependency requests remain rejected,
  SecurityGroup defaulting/immutability remains unchanged, and automatic
  attachments still wait for Allocated + workload Ready.
- Verify omitted or empty API attachments retain existing defaulting and
  missing-default errors. A valid VM that has no tenant attachment provisions
  on the platform default network when disabled; supplied API references retain
  their existing validation, and enabled mode continues tenant placement.

### Unit Tests

- fulfillment-service: max-one validation (accept no attachment or one attachment)
- fulfillment-service: max-one `network_attachments` validation
- fulfillment-service: omitted and partial attachment defaulting (empty `security_groups` is missing; supplied values are preserved; a missing group list defaults only for the tenant default VirtualNetwork and is rejected for a non-default subnet without caller-supplied groups)
- fulfillment-service: BM-only deployment validation (reject VM when no k8s_manager)
- fulfillment-service: auto ExternalIP pool selection (pick READY pool with most capacity, respect IP family)
- osac-operator ComputeInstance controller: `PrimarySubnetRef()` resolution (implicit single attachment)

### Integration Tests

- E2E: create ComputeInstance with two attachments, verify the API rejects the request
- E2E: create ComputeInstance with `--external-ip-attachment`, verify auto ExternalIP + ExternalIPAttachment created, DNAT rule functional
- E2E: delete ComputeInstance with auto-provisioned resources, verify ExternalIPAttachment and ExternalIP cleaned up
- E2E: create ComputeInstance in BM-only deployment, verify error returned
- E2E: create ComputeInstance with one `network_attachments` entry, verify it is used as the default route

### Tricky Test Cases

- ComputeInstance with one attachment (verify implicit default-route behavior)
- ExternalIPPool exhaustion (verify error returned, no resource created)
- Auto-provisioned resource cleanup failure (verify finalizer retry, eventual orphan cleanup)

## Graduation Criteria

- [ ] User feedback incorporated (usability, error messages, edge cases)

## Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

### Upgrade

Micro version upgrades (`x.y.N → x.y.N+2`):
- The repeated `network_attachments` field remains wire-compatible, with validation limiting new requests to one entry
- No user action required

Minor version upgrades (`x.N → x.N+1`):
- The CLI and API continue using the existing `--network-attachment` flag and `network_attachments` field
- No breaking changes — existing single-attachment resources remain functional

### Downgrade

If `N+1` upgrade fails or cluster is misbehaving:
- Manual rollback: update fulfillment-service and osac-operator images to `N`
- Auto-provisioned ExternalIP resources remain (manual cleanup required if not needed)

Acceptable downgrade steps:
- Manually delete orphaned auto-provisioned resources (ExternalIP, ExternalIPAttachment labeled `osac.openshift.io/auto-created: "true"`)

## Version Skew Strategy

### Control Plane Skew

fulfillment-service and osac-operator are deployed together in the same namespace and upgraded atomically (both controlled by osac-installer). No skew expected.

### Client Skew

osac-cli (n-1) with fulfillment-service (n):
- The CLI uses the existing single `--network-attachment` flag and sends the existing `network_attachments` field

osac-cli (n) with fulfillment-service (n-1):
- The CLI remains compatible with the existing `network_attachments` field; a second attachment is rejected client-side and server-side

Recommendation: keep osac-cli and fulfillment-service within one minor version.

## Support Procedures

### Symptom: ComputeInstance stuck in Pending, condition "NetworkingResolutionFailed"

**Detection:**
```bash
kubectl describe computeinstance <name> -n <namespace>
# Check status.conditions for NetworkingResolutionFailed
```

**Cause:** Subnet not found, not Ready, or BM-only deployment (no k8s_manager)

**Resolution:**
1. Check Subnet status: `kubectl get subnet <subnet-name> -n <namespace>`
2. If Subnet is not Ready, investigate Subnet provisioning failure (check AAP job logs)
3. If BM-only deployment, tenant must create VM in a deployment with k8s_manager configured

### Symptom: VM has no default gateway

**Detection:** VM cannot reach external networks, `ip route` shows no default route

**Cause:** The sole attachment was not resolved or the subnet did not provide DHCP gateway information

**Resolution:**
1. Check ComputeInstance spec: `kubectl get computeinstance <name> -n <namespace> -o yaml`
2. Verify the single `networkAttachments[]` entry resolves to the intended subnet
3. If missing or incorrect, delete and re-create ComputeInstance with the intended subnet

### Symptom: Auto-provisioned ExternalIP not cleaned up after ComputeInstance deletion

**Detection:** `kubectl get externalip` shows orphaned ExternalIP labeled `osac.openshift.io/auto-created: "true"` with no parent

**Cause:** Finalizer cleanup failed permanently

**Resolution:**
1. Check ComputeInstance deletion logs (controller logs) for cleanup errors
2. Manually delete orphaned ExternalIPAttachment: `kubectl delete externalipattachment <name> -n <namespace>`
3. Manually delete orphaned ExternalIP: `kubectl delete externalip <name> -n <namespace>`

### Disabling automatic ExternalIP requests

To disable auto ExternalIP attachment:
- Remove or redact ExternalIPPool CRs (capacity exhaustion prevents auto allocation)
- No API extension to disable (fields are part of CRD, cannot be removed at runtime)

Consequences:
- Auto ExternalIP allocation fails with error (resource not created)
- Manual ExternalIP workflows remain functional
- No impact on existing running VMs

### Provider networking intentionally skipped

Set `global.networking.provisioningEnabled=false` through the Helm setting or Enclave Wizard checkbox
installation/upgrade value map and complete both operator rollouts. Inspect
`Ready=True`/`ProvisioningDisabled` conditions on non-allocating Networking API
resources and tracked network job states. Ordinary workload provisioning
remains active with the baseline connectivity described
above. Networking APIs remain available; no provider allocation, routing,
port movement, DHCP discovery, or cleanup is supplied by the skipped path.
Existing provider resources may require manual/provider-side cleanup. [User]

## Infrastructure Needed

- AAP execution environment with `osac.templates.ocp_virt_vm` role updated for single-NIC support
- k8s_manager Ansible role (OSAC-1511 or OSAC-1717) for CUDN overlay provisioning
- Integration test environment with CUDN or EVPN fabric
